**Termination Procedures Policy**

**1\. Purpose**  
The purpose of this Termination Procedures Policy is to establish a standardized process for ensuring that, when an employee, contractor, or any personnel member leaves the organization or no longer requires access to certain systems or data, their access is promptly and securely revoked. This policy aims to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive systems and protect the organization from insider threats.

**2\. Scope**  
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, and any personnel who have been granted access to the organization’s information systems, facilities, or sensitive data. This includes both voluntary and involuntary terminations, as well as temporary or contract-based personnel whose access needs to be revoked when no longer required.

**3\. Policy Statement**

**3.1 Access Revocation**  
Upon termination, all access privileges (physical and logical) shall be immediately revoked to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive systems, data, and facilities. Access revocation should be handled through the following:

- **Logical Access**: Terminate all user accounts, including email, system accounts, application access, and administrative accounts. Disable user accounts before deleting them to ensure that no information is lost or needs to be retrieved.
- **Physical Access**: Collect all keys, access cards, and physical devices that grant access to the organization’s facilities or restricted areas. Revoke access to the building, office areas, and any other restricted spaces.
- **Network Access**: Disable VPN accounts, remote access permissions, and any other network access mechanisms used by the terminated individual.
- **Shared Accounts**: If the individual had access to shared accounts or services, ensure that passwords are changed immediately and all session information is cleared.

**3.2 Account Deactivation**

- **Immediate Deactivation**: Upon notification of an employee’s termination, IT staff must deactivate all accounts and access privileges as soon as possible, ideally within the first few hours or before the individual departs the organization.
- **Deactivation Log**: A log of all account deactivations, including user name, systems affected, and the date/time of deactivation, must be maintained for auditing purposes.
- **Retention of Access for Investigation**: In cases of suspicious termination (e.g., resignation under suspicious circumstances), accounts should be retained in a deactivated state for a period of time to allow for investigation.

**3.3 Return of Organization-Owned Property**

- **Return Process**: Employees are required to return all organization-owned property (e.g., laptops, mobile devices, storage devices, access cards, ID badges, keys, and other equipment) before or at the time of their departure.
- **Inventory Check**: A comprehensive inventory of all equipment issued to the employee should be checked to ensure all items are returned in good condition. Any missing or damaged property must be reported and, where applicable, reimbursed by the departing individual.
- **Remote Devices**: If employees used personal devices (e.g., BYOD) to access organization data, ensure that all remote access permissions are revoked and any organization data is securely wiped from those devices.

**3.4 Data Security and Confidentiality**

- **Data Access Review**: Review the terminated individual’s access to sensitive data or confidential information. Ensure that all access to sensitive information is revoked, and no proprietary or personal data is retained by the individual.
- **Data Retrieval**: Retrieve all data that may be required by the organization, including emails, files, and proprietary documents, from the terminated employee’s accounts or devices. Ensure the secure transfer of data to the appropriate personnel or system.
- **Confidentiality Agreement Reminder**: Remind the departing individual of any confidentiality agreements, non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), or intellectual property obligations that continue after their departure.

**3.5 Exit Interview**  
Conduct an exit interview with the departing employee to discuss the following:

- The return of all organization property.
- The termination of access and the removal of systems, accounts, or keys.
- Confidentiality and intellectual property reminders.
- Any potential issues the employee may have experienced that could affect their return of property or breach of agreements.
- An opportunity for the employee to raise concerns or provide feedback on their experience within the organization.

**3.6 Final Compensation and Benefits**  
Ensure the timely processing of final compensation, benefits, and other entitlements, ensuring that these are aligned with company policy and applicable labor laws. This includes any severance, retirement benefits, or accrued vacation pay.

**4\. Roles and Responsibilities**

- **HR Department**: Responsible for notifying IT and other relevant departments when an employee is terminated. HR will also coordinate the exit interview and ensure that all required documentation is completed.
- **IT Department**: Responsible for deactivating all systems and accounts, revoking access privileges, recovering data, and ensuring that any electronic devices or storage media are wiped or securely destroyed.
- **Security Team**: Responsible for ensuring that physical access is revoked, and that all security mechanisms (e.g., building access systems) are updated accordingly.
- **Line Manager**: Responsible for collecting any physical items or devices from the employee, and ensuring that the employee’s responsibilities are reassigned or transferred to other staff members.
- **Legal/Compliance Department**: Ensures that the termination procedures comply with legal and regulatory requirements, including data retention and destruction laws.

**5\. Enforcement**  
Failure to adhere to this policy may result in disciplinary action, including revocation of access privileges, termination of employment, or legal action, as appropriate. Personnel responsible for the execution of this policy must ensure that all steps are followed and documented.

**6\. Documentation and Recordkeeping**  
All activities related to the termination process, including access revocation, return of property, and data retrieval, must be documented. These records should be retained for a minimum of **(X)** years to comply with organizational or regulatory requirements. Documentation should be securely stored and accessible for auditing and review.

**7\. Review and Revision**  
This policy will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to ensure its effectiveness, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and alignment with organizational needs. Any changes in the procedures or requirements will be communicated to all relevant parties.
