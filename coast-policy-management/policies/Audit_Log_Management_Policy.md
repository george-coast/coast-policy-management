**Audit Log Management Policy**

**1\. Purpose**  
The purpose of this policy is to define requirements for the generation, collection, storage, review, and protection of audit logs to detect, investigate, and mitigate security incidents. It ensures compliance with NIST 800-53 requirements and supports operational and forensic analysis.

**2\. Scope**  
This policy applies to all systems, applications, and devices that process, store, or transmit organizational data. It includes logs generated by network devices, servers, applications, databases, and security tools.

**3\. Policy Statement**

**3.1 Audit Log Requirements**

- All systems and applications must generate audit logs for critical activities, including:
  - User authentication and authorization events (logins, logouts, failed attempts).
  - Access to sensitive or critical resources.
  - Changes to system configurations, permissions, or roles.
  - Use of privileged accounts.
  - Security incidents and events (e.g., malware detections, firewall rule changes).

**3.2 Log Content**  
Audit logs must include the following details where applicable:

- Timestamp (synchronized with a reliable time source).
- User identification (e.g., username, IP address).
- Action performed (e.g., login attempt, file access).
- Source and destination of the event (e.g., IP addresses, resource identifiers).
- Event outcome (e.g., success, failure).

**3.3 Log Collection and Centralization**

- All audit logs must be collected and transmitted securely to a centralized log management system.
- Logs must be transmitted using encrypted protocols (e.g., TLS).
- The centralized system must support log integrity and protection against unauthorized modifications.

**3.4 Log Retention**

- Audit logs must be retained for a minimum of 12 months or longer if required by legal, regulatory, or business needs.
- Archived logs must be stored securely and protected from unauthorized access or tampering.

**3.5 Log Monitoring and Analysis**

- Logs must be reviewed regularly for anomalies, unauthorized access, or other suspicious activities.
- Automated tools must be employed where feasible to detect patterns and alert on potential security incidents.
- High-risk activities and incidents must be escalated immediately to the security team for investigation.

**3.6 Access Control and Protection**

- Access to audit logs must be restricted to authorized personnel only.
- Logs must be protected against unauthorized deletion, modification, or disclosure.
- Regular backups of logs must be created and stored securely.

**3.7 Incident Response Integration**

- Audit logs must be used as a primary source for incident detection and response.
- Logs must be made available for forensic analysis in case of a security incident.

**3.8 Time Synchronization**

- All systems must synchronize their clocks using an authoritative time source (e.g., NTP server) to ensure consistent timestamps across audit logs.

**4\. Roles and Responsibilities**

**4.1 IT and Security Teams**

- Configure systems to generate and transmit audit logs.
- Monitor and analyze logs for security events.
- Ensure log retention and archiving are consistent with policy requirements.

**4.2 System Administrators**

- Implement and verify audit logging configurations on assigned systems.
- Respond promptly to logging errors or failures.

**4.3 Compliance Team**

- Periodically review log management practices for adherence to regulatory and organizational requirements.
- Conduct audits of log data for compliance purposes.

**4.4 All Users**

- Report suspicious activities or security incidents that may be identified through log review.

**5\. Enforcement**  
Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of access privileges or legal action.

**6\. Review and Revision**  
This policy will be reviewed annually or after significant changes to the IT environment or regulatory requirements.
