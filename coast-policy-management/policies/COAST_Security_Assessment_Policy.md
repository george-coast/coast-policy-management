**COAST Security Assessment Policy**

**1\. Purpose**  
The purpose of this policy is to outline the security assessment activities at COAST, specifying the frequency, scope, and responsible parties for each type of assessment. Regular assessments ensure the effectiveness of security controls, identify vulnerabilities, and promote compliance with regulatory standards.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Penetration Testing** | Annual | Public-Facing Sites, Services, and COAST Offices | Third-Party Security Vendor |
| **Vulnerability Scanning** | Monthly | Public-Facing Sites, Services, and COAST Offices | IT Security Team |
| **Vulnerability Scanning (Wazuh Default)** | Weekly | Systems Monitored by Wazuh, including public-facing sites and COAST offices | IT Security Team |
| **Patch Management Review** | Bi-Weekly | Public-Facing Sites, Services, and COAST Offices | IT Security Team |
| **Log Review** | Daily | Logs from Public-Facing Sites and COAST Offices | IT Security Team |
| **Configuration Audit** | Quarterly | Public-Facing Systems and COAST Office Networks | IT Security Team |
| **Risk Register Review** | Monthly | Cybersecurity Risk Register (CSRR) | Risk Management Team |
| **Incident Response Drill** | Semi-Annual | Incident Response for Public-Facing Sites and COAST Offices | IT Security & Risk Team |
| **User Access Review** | Semi-Annual | Accounts with Access to Public-Facing Sites and COAST Offices | IT Compliance Team |

**3\. Assessment Objectives**  
The goal of the security assessments is to evaluate the current security posture, identify weaknesses, and verify compliance with COAST's security policies. These assessments help mitigate risks and ensure the protection of sensitive information.

**4\. Assessment Methodology**  
Each assessment follows the process outlined below:

1. **Planning**: Define the scope, objectives, and criteria for each assessment type.
2. **Execution**: Conduct assessments using industry-standard methodologies and tools.
3. **Reporting**: Document findings, including identified risks, vulnerabilities, and recommendations for corrective actions.
4. **Remediation**: Develop and implement remediation plans to address identified issues.
5. **Verification**: Follow up to ensure that corrective actions have been successfully implemented.

**5\. Roles and Responsibilities**

- **IT Security Team**:  
    Responsible for conducting regular vulnerability scans, patch management reviews, log reviews, and configuration audits. They also coordinate incident response drills and manage security incidents.
- **Third-Party Security Vendor**:  
    Engaged to conduct annual penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities in public-facing sites and services.
- **Risk Management Team**:  
    Responsible for reviewing the Cybersecurity Risk Register (CSRR) monthly, ensuring risks are identified, tracked, and mitigated.
- **IT Compliance Team**:  
    Responsible for conducting the semi-annual user access review to ensure that only authorized individuals have access to critical systems.
- **IT Security & Risk Team**:  
    Coordinates and participates in the semi-annual incident response drills to ensure preparedness for potential security incidents.

**6\. Remediation and Risk Mitigation**  
Each assessment will result in a report that includes recommended corrective actions. The severity of issues will determine the priority for remediation:

- **Critical Issues**: Immediate remediation required (within 30 days).
- **High Risks**: Remediation required within 60 days.
- **Medium Risks**: Remediation required within 90 days.
- **Low Risks**: Remediation required within 180 days or at the next major update cycle.

All remediation efforts will be tracked and reported to ensure effective risk management.

**7\. Enforcement**  
Failure to comply with this policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination for employees, and contract termination for third-party vendors.

**8\. Review and Updates**  
This policy and the associated security assessment schedule will be reviewed annually to ensure it remains effective and aligned with industry best practices and regulatory requirements. Adjustments will be made based on lessons learned, changes in the threat landscape, and evolving business needs.
