**Disaster Recovery Plan**

**1\. Purpose**  
The purpose of this Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) is to outline strategies and procedures for recovering critical systems, applications, and data to ensure business continuity after a disaster or significant disruption.

**2\. Scope**  
This plan applies to all systems, applications, and infrastructure critical to the organization’s operations, including third-party and cloud-based services.

**3\. Objectives**

- Restore critical systems and applications within predefined Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs).
- Ensure data is recovered according to Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs).
- Minimize operational downtime and financial losses.
- Maintain compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

**4\. Plan Activation**  
**4.1 Disaster Definition**  
A disaster is any event that causes unplanned disruption to critical systems, including:

- Natural disasters (e.g., floods, fires, earthquakes).
- Cyberattacks (e.g., ransomware, denial of service).
- Hardware or software failures.

**4.2 Activation Criteria**  
The DRP is activated when:

- Critical systems or data are unavailable beyond the RTO.
- The Incident Response Team determines recovery procedures are necessary.
- A disaster is declared by authorized personnel.

**4.3 Authorization to Activate**  
The following roles are authorized to activate the DRP:

- Chief Information Officer (CIO).
- Disaster Recovery Manager (DRM).
- Incident Response Team Lead.

**5\. Disaster Recovery Procedures**

**5.1 Initial Response**

1. Assess the nature and extent of the disaster.
2. Notify key stakeholders, including IT, security, and executive teams.
3. Declare disaster recovery activation if criteria are met.

**5.2 Communication Plan**

- Establish communication channels to coordinate recovery efforts.
- Notify employees, customers, and vendors as appropriate.
- Provide regular updates on recovery progress.

**5.3 Recovery Steps**

1. **Data Recovery**
    - Restore backups from the most recent verified copies.
    - Verify data integrity before restoration is completed.
2. **System Recovery**
    - Prioritize recovery of systems based on criticality.
    - Rebuild or replace affected hardware as necessary.
    - Restore operating systems and applications from secure sources.
3. **Testing and Validation**
    - Verify system functionality after recovery.
    - Ensure recovered systems meet security and compliance requirements.
4. **Full Restoration**
    - Gradually bring recovered systems back online.
    - Notify stakeholders when systems are fully operational.

**6\. Roles and Responsibilities**

**6.1 Disaster Recovery Manager (DRM)**

- Oversee the execution of the DRP.
- Coordinate with IT, security, and external vendors.
- Maintain and update the DRP.

**6.2 IT and Security Teams**

- Execute system recovery procedures.
- Validate restored systems and applications.
- Identify vulnerabilities or gaps in recovery procedures.

**6.3 Communication Team**

- Manage communication with internal and external stakeholders.
- Ensure clear and accurate messaging during recovery efforts.

**6.4 Employees**

- Follow instructions provided by the DRM and recovery team.
- Report issues or concerns during the recovery process.

**7\. Testing and Maintenance**

**7.1 Testing**

- Conduct disaster recovery testing at least annually.
- Use simulated disaster scenarios to evaluate plan effectiveness.
- Document results and address gaps or weaknesses.

**7.2 Maintenance**

- Review and update the DRP annually or after significant system changes.
- Ensure all team members are trained on their roles in the DRP.

**8\. Backup Strategy**

- All critical data must be backed up regularly according to the organization’s **Data Backup Policy**.
- Backups must be stored securely, with redundancy, and tested periodically for integrity.

**9\. Metrics and Reporting**

- Track RTO and RPO performance during recovery efforts.
- Document recovery timelines, issues encountered, and lessons learned.
- Submit post-disaster reports to executive management.

**10\. Enforcement**  
Failure to comply with this plan may result in disciplinary action, including restricted access to systems or termination of employment. Third parties that do not adhere to recovery procedures may face contract termination.
