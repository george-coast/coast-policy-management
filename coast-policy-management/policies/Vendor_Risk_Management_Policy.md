**Vendor Risk Management Policy**

**1\. Purpose**  
The purpose of this Vendor Risk Management Policy is to establish the framework for identifying, assessing, and managing risks associated with third-party vendors that provide goods, services, or access to critical systems and data. This policy ensures that third-party relationships are managed effectively to protect the organization’s sensitive information, systems, and assets.

**2\. Scope**  
This policy applies to all third-party vendors, contractors, and service providers who have access to the organization’s information systems, data, or infrastructure. It includes both direct and indirect vendors, including those who have access to sensitive or confidential data, or who provide critical services that could affect the organization’s operations or security posture.

**3\. Policy Statement**

**3.1 Vendor Risk Assessment**  
The organization will conduct a comprehensive risk assessment for all third-party vendors prior to entering into a contract and periodically thereafter. This assessment will evaluate the vendor's security practices, financial stability, compliance with relevant regulations, and potential risks posed by the vendor’s access to sensitive data or systems. The risk assessment will include:

- **Data Security**: Evaluation of the vendor’s ability to secure sensitive data, including personal identifiable information (PII), financial data, and intellectual property.
- **Operational Risk**: Assessment of the vendor's ability to meet operational performance standards and minimize disruptions to business processes.
- **Compliance Risk**: Review of the vendor's adherence to industry-specific regulations, data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), and contractual obligations.
- **Financial Risk**: Evaluation of the vendor’s financial health to ensure they can maintain the ability to perform contracted services over time.
- **Cybersecurity Risk**: Assessing the vendor's cybersecurity posture and their ability to manage and mitigate cyber threats, including physical security, network security, and incident response capabilities.

**3.2 Due Diligence Process**  
Before entering into any third-party agreement, the organization will conduct due diligence to evaluate the vendor’s capabilities in areas such as:

- **Security Policies and Controls**: Review of the vendor’s security policies, practices, and controls, including physical security, data encryption, authentication, and access management.
- **Incident Response**: Evaluation of the vendor’s incident response plan and their ability to notify the organization of security incidents affecting the contract.
- **Contractual Obligations**: The organization will ensure that contracts with vendors include terms that address security, compliance, and risk management obligations. This includes ensuring vendors provide clear terms for data handling, breach notification, and audit rights.

**3.3 Third-Party Security Requirements**  
Vendors who handle sensitive information or provide critical services must meet the organization’s security requirements, including:

- **Data Protection**: Vendors must implement appropriate data protection measures, including data encryption, access controls, and data classification schemes.
- **Audit and Monitoring**: Vendors must allow the organization to perform security audits and monitoring to ensure ongoing compliance with contractual and security requirements.
- **Business Continuity**: Vendors must have documented business continuity and disaster recovery plans in place to mitigate potential disruptions in service.

**3.4 Ongoing Monitoring and Review**  
The organization will regularly monitor and review the performance and risk profile of third-party vendors. This includes:

- **Performance Monitoring**: Regular assessment of the vendor’s performance against agreed-upon service level agreements (SLAs).
- **Security Assessments**: Ongoing evaluations of the vendor’s security posture and practices, including conducting vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and cybersecurity audits, where appropriate.
- **Compliance Audits**: Periodic audits to ensure that the vendor is complying with contractual, regulatory, and security requirements.
- **Vendor Risk Re-assessment**: The organization will periodically reassess the risks associated with existing vendors, particularly if there are changes in the vendor's business practices, regulatory environment, or the security landscape.

**3.5 Vendor Termination**  
When a vendor relationship is terminated, the organization will ensure that all access to sensitive data, systems, and infrastructure is revoked, and any proprietary information is returned or destroyed according to the terms of the contract. The organization will also:

- **Data Return or Destruction**: Ensure that all data provided to the vendor is returned or securely destroyed upon contract termination, in compliance with data retention policies.
- **Access Termination**: Revoke all user access privileges to systems, networks, or applications, ensuring that there are no remaining connections or vulnerabilities after termination.
- **Exit Interviews**: Conduct exit interviews with the vendor to ensure compliance with contractual obligations and address any potential concerns regarding data security or transition.

**3.6 Vendor Access to Sensitive Information**  
Vendors who require access to sensitive information or systems must adhere to the following requirements:

- **Access Control**: Vendors must be granted the minimum necessary access to perform their work, in accordance with the principle of least privilege.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: For vendors with access to critical systems or sensitive data, multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be required.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Activities performed by vendors on organizational systems will be logged and monitored to detect any unauthorized access or suspicious activity.

**4\. Roles and Responsibilities**

- **Risk Management Team**: Responsible for overseeing the risk assessment and due diligence processes for all third-party vendors.
- **Procurement Team**: Ensures that security and compliance requirements are included in contracts and that vendors are evaluated for risk before entering into a relationship.
- **IT and Security Team**: Conducts security assessments, audits, and ongoing monitoring of vendor activities, ensuring that vendors comply with security policies.
- **Legal and Compliance Team**: Reviews vendor contracts to ensure compliance with applicable regulations and ensures that the organization’s legal obligations are met.
- **Vendor Management Team**: Responsible for maintaining relationships with vendors, ensuring performance meets agreed-upon standards, and addressing any concerns related to third-party risk.

**5\. Enforcement**  
Non-compliance with this policy by vendors may result in termination of contracts, legal action, and other corrective measures, depending on the severity of the violation. Internal employees found violating this policy may face disciplinary actions as per organizational guidelines.

**6\. Documentation and Recordkeeping**  
All records related to vendor risk assessments, due diligence, contracts, and security audits will be maintained in accordance with the organization’s retention policies. These records must be securely stored and easily accessible for audits and review by relevant stakeholders.

**7\. Review and Revision**  
This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually or whenever there are significant changes in the regulatory environment, vendor landscape, or organizational priorities. The review process will ensure that the policy remains aligned with industry best practices and organizational goals.
