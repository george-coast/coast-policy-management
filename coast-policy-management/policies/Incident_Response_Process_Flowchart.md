**Incident Response Process Flowchart**

**Overview**

This flowchart provides a structured response for cybersecurity incidents based on the NIST 800-53 framework. It guides teams through detection, containment, eradication, and recovery to ensure a rapid and effective incident response.

**Incident Response Process**

**1\. Detection & Identification**

- **Monitor logs and alerts** from Wazuh SIEM, Snort IDS, and system logs.
- **Identify suspicious activities** such as unauthorized access, malware infections, or data breaches.
- **Classify the incident** based on severity and impact.

**Decision Point:** Is this a false positive?

- **Yes** → No further action required.
- **No** → Proceed to Containment.

**2\. Containment**

- **For network-based incidents:** Block malicious IPs using pfSense firewall.
- **For compromised accounts:** Disable affected user accounts in JumpCloud.
- **For malware infections:** Isolate affected endpoints.

**Decision Point:** Is additional containment required?

- **Yes** → Escalate to security teams and take further action.
- **No** → Proceed to Eradication.

**3\. Eradication**

- **Remove threats** by running antivirus/malware removal tools.
- **Revoke compromised credentials** and generate new API keys if necessary.
- **Patch vulnerabilities** to prevent reinfection.

**Decision Point:** Has the threat been successfully removed?

- **Yes** → Proceed to Recovery.
- **No** → Reassess containment and eradication steps.

**4\. Recovery**

- **Restore affected systems** from secure backups.
- **Verify integrity** of critical services and applications.
- **Monitor for recurring threats** before full operational restoration.

**Decision Point:** Is the system fully restored and stable?

- **Yes** → Proceed to Post-Incident Analysis.
- **No** → Reassess recovery efforts.

**5\. Post-Incident Analysis & Lessons Learned**

- **Conduct a root cause analysis** to determine how the incident occurred.
- **Document findings** and update the Incident Response Plan.
- **Implement additional security measures** to prevent recurrence.
- **Provide training and awareness** to relevant teams.

**Flowchart Representation**

**\[Start\]** → Detection & Identification → \[Decision: False Positive?\] → No → Containment → \[Decision: Additional Containment?\] → No → Eradication → \[Decision: Threat Removed?\] → Yes → Recovery → \[Decision: System Stable?\] → Yes → Post-Incident Analysis → **\[End\]**

**Additional Considerations**

- **Autonomous Vehicle Systems:** Ensure redundancy in GPS location verification and isolate compromised robotic functions.
- **AWS ECS Supervisor System:** Utilize IAM role restrictions and multi-factor authentication for high-risk incidents.
- **Out-of-Band Communications:** Maintain a separate communication channel for emergency coordination.
- **Ethernet Kill Switch Activation:** Disconnect affected networks in case of a critical security breach.
