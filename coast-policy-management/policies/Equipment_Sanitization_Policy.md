**Equipment Sanitization Policy**

**1\. Purpose**  
The purpose of this policy is to define the procedures for sanitizing organizational equipment, including computers, servers, mobile devices, and any other technology that stores, processes, or transmits sensitive information. The policy ensures that sensitive data is securely erased to prevent unauthorized access after equipment is no longer in use or is being transferred.

**2\. Scope**  
This policy applies to all equipment owned or operated by the organization, including hardware such as computers, servers, storage devices, mobile phones, and other electronic devices that may store sensitive data. The policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors handling organizational equipment.

**3\. Policy Statement**

**3.1 Equipment Sanitization Requirements**

- All equipment that stores sensitive data must be sanitized before being disposed of, repurposed, or transferred.
- Sanitization must ensure that all sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII) is completely removed from the equipment before it is decommissioned, recycled, or sold.
- Sanitization must include the removal of data from internal storage (e.g., hard drives, SSDs), removable media, and cloud storage associated with the equipment.

**3.2 Sanitization Methods**

- **Data Destruction**: The destruction of data must be done in a way that makes it irretrievable, including physical destruction of the storage device (e.g., shredding, crushing).
- **Data Overwriting**: If physical destruction is not an option, data overwriting methods must be used. At least three overwriting passes using a certified tool must be used to ensure data is irrecoverable.
- **Degaussing**: Degaussing is required for magnetic storage devices (e.g., traditional hard drives) to ensure that the data cannot be recovered.
- **Factory Reset (for mobile devices)**: All mobile devices must be returned to their factory settings, ensuring that no personal or organizational data remains.
- **Secure Wiping for Cloud Devices**: When transferring or decommissioning cloud-based systems, all sensitive data must be securely wiped according to vendor policies.

**3.3 Sanitization Prior to Disposal or Repurposing**

- Before any equipment is disposed of, sold, or repurposed, it must be sanitized in accordance with this policy.
- The equipment should be inspected to ensure all data is removed, and any personal or sensitive data should be securely erased.
- For non-removable storage (e.g., mobile devices, built-in storage), equipment must be wiped using an approved sanitization tool before being repurposed.
- For any equipment that cannot be securely sanitized, it must be physically destroyed.

**3.4 Third-Party Equipment Disposal**

- Any third-party vendors or contractors handling the sanitization of organizational equipment must comply with the organization's equipment sanitization policies.
- The organization must request and retain certificates of sanitization or destruction from third-party vendors for verification and auditing purposes.
- The vendor’s sanitization practices must be reviewed and approved by the IT Security team before engagement.

**3.5 Documentation and Auditing**

- All equipment sanitization activities must be documented, including the device ID, method of sanitization, and the personnel involved.
- A record of all sanitized or destroyed equipment must be maintained for auditing and compliance purposes.
- Audits of the sanitization process will be conducted periodically to ensure compliance with this policy.

**3.6 Data Retention Considerations**

- Any data that needs to be retained (e.g., backup data, archived data) must be removed from the equipment prior to sanitization and stored securely according to the organization’s data retention policy.
- The organization must ensure that all legal, regulatory, and contractual data retention requirements are met before sanitizing equipment.

**4\. Roles and Responsibilities**

**4.1 IT Security Team**

- Develop and maintain the equipment sanitization policy and procedures.
- Oversee the sanitization process and ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations.
- Approve and monitor third-party vendors for equipment sanitization services.
- Conduct periodic audits to verify the effectiveness of the sanitization process.

**4.2 Equipment Custodians**

- Ensure that all equipment assigned to them is sanitized in accordance with the policy before disposal, repurposing, or transfer.
- Maintain records of all sanitization activities for auditing purposes.

**4.3 Third-Party Vendors**

- Ensure that equipment sanitization meets organizational standards and best practices.
- Provide certificates of sanitization or destruction upon completion of work.

**5\. Training and Awareness**

- All employees handling organizational equipment must receive training on the importance of data sanitization and the methods used to securely erase sensitive data.
- IT staff must be trained in the latest equipment sanitization technologies and best practices to ensure that sensitive information is securely erased.

**6\. Enforcement**  
Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, including but not limited to restricted access to organizational equipment, reassignment of duties, or termination.

**7\. Review and Revision**  
This policy will be reviewed annually or whenever there are significant changes in technology, regulations, or equipment. Updates to this policy will be communicated to all relevant stakeholders.
