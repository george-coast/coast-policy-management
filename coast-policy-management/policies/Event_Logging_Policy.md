**Event Logging Policy**

**1\. Purpose**  
The purpose of this policy is to establish requirements for the logging of events across organizational systems to support the detection, analysis, and investigation of security incidents and ensure compliance with applicable standards such as NIST 800-53.

**2\. Scope**  
This policy applies to all organizational systems, applications, devices, and network components that process, store, or transmit organizational data. It also applies to all employees, contractors, and third parties managing these systems.

**3\. Policy Statement**

**3.1 Logging Requirements**

- **Systems and Applications**: All critical systems and applications must enable logging to capture relevant events.
- **Event Types**: Logged events must include, but are not limited to:
  - **Access Events**: Logins, logouts, failed authentication attempts, session creation, and termination.
  - **Privilege Use**: Changes to user roles, permissions, or administrative actions.
  - **System Changes**: Configuration modifications, software updates, or patch applications.
  - **Data Access**: Access to sensitive data, file creation, deletion, and modification.
  - **Security Events**: Firewall changes, intrusion attempts, malware detections, and policy violations.
- **Log Details**: Logs must include the following data where applicable:
  - Timestamp (synchronized with a trusted time source).
  - User or process ID.
  - Source and destination (e.g., IP address, system name).
  - Description of the event or action taken.
  - Status or outcome (e.g., success, failure).

**3.2 Log Storage**

- Logs must be stored in a centralized and secure logging solution.
- Redundant storage must be implemented to ensure log availability during hardware or system failures.

**3.3 Log Retention and Disposal**

- Event logs must be retained for a minimum of 12 months or as required by legal, regulatory, or operational needs.
- After the retention period, logs must be securely deleted or archived following organizational data disposal procedures.

**3.4 Access Control**

- Access to event logs must be restricted to authorized personnel only.
- Logs must be protected against unauthorized access, modification, or deletion.
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) must be enforced for accessing critical log management systems.

**3.5 Real-Time Monitoring and Alerting**

- Automated systems must monitor logs for suspicious or unauthorized activities in real-time.
- Alerts must be generated for high-priority events such as:
  - Repeated failed login attempts.
  - Unauthorized access to sensitive systems or data.
  - Changes to security configurations.

**3.6 Log Integrity and Security**

- Logs must be encrypted during transmission and storage to protect sensitive information.
- Hashing techniques must be used to ensure log integrity and detect tampering.

**3.7 Audit and Review**

- Logs must be reviewed periodically to identify potential security incidents or policy violations.
- Regular audits of the logging process must be conducted to ensure compliance with this policy.

**3.8 Incident Response**

- Event logs must be used as a primary source for incident detection, investigation, and response.
- Logs must be retained and preserved during security investigations for forensic purposes.

**3.9 Time Synchronization**

- All systems must synchronize with a trusted time source (e.g., NTP server) to maintain accurate timestamps in logs.

**4\. Roles and Responsibilities**

**4.1 IT and Security Teams**

- Configure and manage event logging on all critical systems.
- Monitor logs and respond to alerts.
- Ensure compliance with retention, storage, and access requirements.

**4.2 System Administrators**

- Ensure proper log generation and configuration on assigned systems.
- Address logging errors or gaps promptly.

**4.3 Compliance and Audit Teams**

- Validate adherence to logging requirements through periodic audits.
- Ensure retention and disposal practices align with regulatory standards.

**4.4 All Employees**

- Report anomalies or events indicating potential security incidents.

**5\. Enforcement**  
Non-compliance with this policy may result in disciplinary action, loss of access privileges, or legal consequences.

**6\. Review and Revision**  
This policy will be reviewed annually or after significant changes in the IT environment, regulatory requirements, or logging technologies.
