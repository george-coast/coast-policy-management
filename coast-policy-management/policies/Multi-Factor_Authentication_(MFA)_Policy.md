**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Policy**

**1\. Purpose**  
The purpose of this policy is to establish the requirements for implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) within the organization to enhance the security of sensitive systems, applications, and data. MFA reduces the risk of unauthorized access by requiring multiple forms of verification before granting access.

**2\. Scope**  
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, third-party vendors, and users accessing organizational systems, networks, applications, and sensitive data.

**3\. Policy Statement**

**3.1 Requirements for Multi-Factor Authentication**

- MFA must be implemented for access to all systems and applications that store, process, or transmit sensitive or regulated information.
- MFA is required for access to:
  - Privileged accounts (e.g., system administrators, database administrators).
  - Remote access to the organization's network (VPN, web applications, etc.).
  - Cloud-based applications (e.g., email, file storage).
  - Internal systems that handle financial, personal, or confidential data.

**3.2 Authentication Factors**  
MFA must involve two or more of the following authentication factors:

- **Something you know:** A password, PIN, or passphrase.
- **Something you have:** A hardware token, smartphone, or smart card.
- **Something you are:** Biometric authentication (fingerprint, facial recognition, etc.).

**3.3 Approved MFA Methods**

- MFA methods must be consistent with industry standards and the organization’s security requirements.
- Approved methods include:
  - Hardware tokens (e.g., YubiKey, RSA SecureID).
  - Software-based tokens (e.g., Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator).
  - Biometric authentication (fingerprint, facial recognition).
  - SMS-based or email-based one-time passcodes (for lower-risk access or in specific cases only).
- Use of SMS or email as the sole factor for MFA is discouraged due to security concerns and should be avoided unless no other option is available.

**3.4 Exceptions and Risk Mitigation**

- Any exception to the MFA requirement must be documented and approved by the IT Security team.
- In cases where MFA is not feasible for specific systems, risk-based mitigation controls must be implemented, such as additional logging, monitoring, or access restrictions.

**3.5 Emergency Access**

- Emergency access accounts or break-glass accounts must also require MFA and should be used only in exceptional circumstances.
- Emergency access credentials must be tightly controlled, monitored, and periodically reviewed.

**3.6 Enforcement**

- Users failing to comply with MFA requirements will be denied access to systems that require MFA for authentication.
- The IT Security team will conduct regular audits to verify that MFA controls are implemented and enforced across all required systems.

**4\. Roles and Responsibilities**

**4.1 IT Security Team**

- Design, implement, and enforce the MFA program across the organization.
- Monitor the MFA implementation for compliance and effectiveness.
- Provide support and training to end-users on MFA usage.

**4.2 System Administrators**

- Ensure that systems and applications enforce MFA requirements.
- Configure and maintain MFA tools and systems for end-users.

**4.3 Users**

- Enroll in MFA and use the required methods for accessing organizational systems.
- Report any issues with MFA devices or authentication immediately.

**5\. Training and Awareness**

- All users must receive training on how to enroll in and use MFA as part of their onboarding process.
- Ongoing training will be provided to ensure users are aware of new MFA methods and potential security threats related to authentication.

**6\. Enforcement**  
Failure to comply with the MFA policy may result in access being revoked or other disciplinary actions in accordance with the organization’s enforcement protocols.

**7\. Review and Revision**  
This policy will be reviewed annually, or when significant changes to MFA technology or security requirements occur. Updates to this policy will be communicated to all users and stakeholders.
