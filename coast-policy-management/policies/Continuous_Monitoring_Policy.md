**Continuous Monitoring Policy**

**1\. Purpose**  
The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for continuous monitoring of organizational systems and networks to ensure ongoing security, identify vulnerabilities, and mitigate risks promptly. This policy supports compliance with NIST 800-53 requirements.

**2\. Scope**  
This policy applies to all organizational systems, applications, networks, and data that require security monitoring, including third-party managed systems.

**3\. Policy Statement**

**3.1 Continuous Monitoring Requirements**

- **System Monitoring**: All organizational systems must implement tools and processes to continuously monitor security events, performance, and compliance with security policies.
- **Vulnerability Management**: Regular vulnerability assessments and scans must be performed on all systems to identify and remediate weaknesses.
- **Event Logging**: All critical systems and applications must log events, including authentication attempts, system changes, and security incidents.
- **Threat Detection**: Use automated tools such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions to detect potential threats.
- **Configuration Management**: Monitor systems for unauthorized changes to configurations or settings.

**3.2 Key Monitoring Activities**

- **Security Alerts**: Generate alerts for suspicious activities such as unauthorized access attempts, data exfiltration, or malware infections.
- **Compliance Checks**: Verify that systems remain compliant with security baselines and regulatory requirements.
- **Patch Management**: Monitor for missing patches and ensure timely updates to software and operating systems.
- **Access Monitoring**: Continuously review access logs to detect anomalies in user behavior, particularly for privileged accounts.

**3.3 Reporting and Notification**

- **Incident Reports**: Identified security incidents must be reported to the Incident Response Team immediately.
- **Monitoring Reports**: Regular monitoring reports, including system health and vulnerability summaries, must be reviewed by the IT and security teams.

**3.4 Integration with Risk Management**  
Findings from continuous monitoring activities must be integrated into the risk management process to prioritize mitigation efforts.

**4\. Roles and Responsibilities**

**4.1 IT and Security Teams**

- Configure and maintain monitoring tools.
- Analyze logs and alerts to identify and address security incidents.
- Provide monitoring reports to management regularly.

**4.2 System Owners**

- Ensure systems are configured to support continuous monitoring requirements.
- Work with the IT team to address identified vulnerabilities.

**4.3 Risk Management Team**

- Assess risks identified through monitoring activities.
- Update the organization’s risk register with new findings.

**4.4 Management**

- Review monitoring summaries and ensure appropriate resources are allocated to mitigate identified risks.

**5\. Enforcement**  
Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, including loss of system access. Systems that cannot support continuous monitoring requirements may be removed from operation.

**6\. Review and Revision**  
This policy must be reviewed annually or when significant changes occur to the organization’s systems, environment, or threat landscape.
