**Backup and Restore Policy**

**1\. Purpose**  
This policy establishes requirements for creating, storing, and maintaining backups of critical systems, applications, and data to ensure their availability and recoverability in case of system failure, data corruption, or disaster.

**2\. Scope**  
This policy applies to all systems, applications, databases, and data owned or managed by the organization. It includes on-premise, cloud, and third-party systems.

**3\. Policy Statement**

**3.1 Backup Requirements**

- **Critical Data and Systems**: All critical data and systems must be identified and included in regular backups.
- **Backup Frequency**:
  - Daily incremental backups for operational data.
  - Weekly full backups for all critical systems and data.
  - Monthly archival backups for long-term storage.
- **Backup Storage**:
  - Backups must be stored in a secure location with access controls.
  - At least one backup copy must be stored offsite or in the cloud for redundancy.
- **Retention Periods**:
  - Operational backups: Retain for 30 days.
  - Archival backups: Retain for a minimum of 7 years or as required by regulatory compliance.

**3.2 Backup Verification**

- Perform regular testing of backup processes to ensure data integrity and recoverability.
- Verify backups through test restorations at least quarterly.

**3.3 Data Classification and Protection**

- Backup data must be encrypted in transit and at rest to protect sensitive information.
- Classification labels (e.g., confidential, restricted) must be applied to backup copies according to the organizationâ€™s **Data Classification Policy**.

**3.4 Restore Procedures**

- Restorations must be performed according to the **Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)** and operational needs.
- Restore testing must be conducted annually to validate recovery time objectives (RTOs) and recovery point objectives (RPOs).

**3.5 Emergency Restoration**

- Prioritize restoration of critical systems in the event of a disaster.
- The Incident Response Team must oversee emergency restore operations.

**3.6 Backup Monitoring**

- Monitor backup processes daily to detect and resolve issues.
- Retain backup logs for at least 90 days for audit purposes.

**4\. Roles and Responsibilities**

**4.1 IT Operations Team**

- Implement and monitor backup schedules.
- Verify backup integrity through routine testing.
- Respond to backup or restore issues promptly.

**4.2 System Owners**

- Identify critical data and ensure it is included in backup processes.
- Approve and review backup and restoration processes specific to their systems.

**4.3 IT Security Team**

- Ensure encryption and access control requirements are met.
- Validate the security of offsite and cloud backup locations.

**4.4 Employees**

- Store files and data in designated systems that are included in backup processes.
- Report issues with data access or loss promptly.

**5\. Metrics and Reporting**

- Track backup success rates, failures, and restore test results.
- Submit regular backup status reports to senior management.

**6\. Enforcement**  
Non-compliance with this policy may result in disciplinary action, including restricted access to IT systems. Third-party vendors must adhere to backup and restore requirements or face contract termination.

**7\. Review and Revision**  
This policy will be reviewed annually or following significant changes to IT systems, regulatory requirements, or business operations.
