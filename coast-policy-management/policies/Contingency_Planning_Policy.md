**Contingency Planning Policy**

**1\. Purpose**  
The purpose of this policy is to ensure the organization can effectively respond to and recover from unexpected events, such as system outages, natural disasters, cyberattacks, or other incidents that disrupt operations.

**2\. Scope**  
This policy applies to all systems, applications, personnel, and facilities owned or operated by the organization. It also includes third-party systems and services critical to operations.

**3\. Policy Statement**

**3.1 Contingency Plan Development**

- Each critical system and application must have a documented contingency plan, including:
  - Identification of critical assets and dependencies.
  - Risk assessments for potential disruptions.
  - Recovery objectives (Recovery Time Objective \[RTO\] and Recovery Point Objective \[RPO\]).
  - Roles and responsibilities for executing contingency plans.

**3.2 Data Backup and Recovery**

- All critical data must be backed up regularly in alignment with the organization’s **Data Backup Policy**.
- Backups must be stored in secure, redundant locations, with at least one copy offsite.
- Backup integrity must be tested periodically to ensure recoverability.

**3.3 Business Impact Analysis (BIA)**

- Conduct a BIA annually to:
  - Identify critical systems and functions.
  - Determine the potential impact of disruptions.
  - Prioritize recovery efforts based on business requirements.

**3.4 Incident Response Integration**

- Contingency plans must integrate with the organization’s **Incident Response Plan** to coordinate responses to security events.
- Incident containment, communication, and recovery must align with contingency objectives.

**3.5 Disaster Recovery Planning**

- Disaster recovery plans must address:
  - Immediate actions to be taken during a disaster.
  - System restoration procedures.
  - Communication protocols for notifying stakeholders.

**3.6 Plan Testing and Exercises**

- Contingency plans must be tested at least annually using simulations or tabletop exercises.
- Test results must be documented, and plans updated to address identified gaps or weaknesses.

**3.7 Plan Maintenance**

- Contingency plans must be reviewed and updated:
  - Annually.
  - When significant changes occur to systems, processes, or threats.

**4\. Roles and Responsibilities**

**4.1 Contingency Planning Team**

- Develop and maintain contingency plans for critical systems and processes.
- Coordinate contingency planning efforts across the organization.
- Conduct testing and update plans based on results and organizational changes.

**4.2 IT and Security Teams**

- Ensure systems and data are backed up according to policy.
- Support recovery efforts during disruptions.
- Collaborate with stakeholders to assess risks and define recovery objectives.

**4.3 System Owners**

- Provide input for contingency plans specific to their systems.
- Participate in plan testing and review.

**4.4 Employees**

- Follow contingency procedures during disruptions.
- Report incidents or conditions that may trigger contingency plans.

**5\. Enforcement**  
Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, including restricted access to systems or termination of employment. Non-compliance by third parties may lead to contract termination.

**6\. Review and Revision**  
This policy will be reviewed annually or following significant changes to the organization’s systems, operations, or threat environment.
