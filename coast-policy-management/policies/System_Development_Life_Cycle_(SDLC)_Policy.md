**System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Policy**

**1\. Purpose**  
The purpose of this policy is to establish a standardized framework for managing the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) of all information systems within the organization. This policy ensures that all systems are developed, tested, deployed, and maintained in a secure and efficient manner, adhering to organizational requirements and compliance standards, including NIST 800-53.

**2\. Scope**  
This policy applies to all information systems, software, and applications developed or acquired by the organization, including:

- In-house developed systems
- Third-party software and systems acquired by the organization
- Customizations to existing systems or software
- Any system or software integrated into the organization's IT infrastructure

The policy applies to all departments, teams, and contractors involved in the development, acquisition, implementation, and maintenance of these systems.

**3\. Policy Statement**

**3.1 SDLC Phases**  
The organization shall follow a structured, well-defined SDLC process to ensure the development of secure, reliable, and compliant systems. The SDLC process includes the following phases:

- **Planning and Requirements Analysis**
  - Define the purpose, scope, and objectives of the system or project.
  - Conduct risk assessments and gather functional and non-functional requirements.
  - Identify stakeholders and document security and compliance requirements.
  - Prepare a system development plan, including timelines, resource requirements, and budget estimates.
- **System Design**
  - Develop the system architecture, ensuring that security and privacy controls are incorporated from the start.
  - Define system components, interfaces, and data flow.
  - Perform security and vulnerability assessments to identify potential risks.
  - Design system controls to meet NIST 800-53 and other applicable standards.
- **Implementation and Development**
  - Develop the system or software based on the design specifications.
  - Implement security controls such as access management, encryption, and logging during development.
  - Follow secure coding practices and standards to minimize vulnerabilities.
  - Conduct code reviews and vulnerability assessments to identify and mitigate potential security flaws.
- **Testing**
  - Perform thorough testing of the system to ensure functionality and security.
  - Conduct unit tests, integration tests, user acceptance tests (UAT), and security testing (e.g., penetration testing, vulnerability scanning).
  - Ensure that security controls are functioning correctly and that data is handled in compliance with privacy and security policies.
  - Document and address any issues or risks identified during testing.
- **Deployment and Implementation**
  - Deploy the system to the production environment, ensuring that the system is fully configured, patched, and tested before launch.
  - Implement monitoring and logging to track system behavior and detect potential security incidents.
  - Provide training to end-users, administrators, and support personnel on system functionality and security best practices.
  - Ensure data migration and integration are performed securely.
- **Operations and Maintenance**
  - Regularly update and patch the system to fix vulnerabilities, improve performance, and address any identified issues.
  - Continuously monitor the system for security events and perform regular audits.
  - Maintain documentation for system changes, configurations, and updates.
  - Review and refine the system to ensure it meets evolving organizational needs and security requirements.
- **Disposal/Decommissioning**
  - When the system reaches the end of its useful life or is replaced, ensure that it is decommissioned securely.
  - Perform secure data deletion to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.
  - Document the decommissioning process and ensure all assets are disposed of in compliance with the organization's policies and regulatory requirements.

**3.2 Secure Development Practices**  
To ensure the integrity and security of systems, the organization shall adhere to the following principles during the SDLC:

- **Security by Design**: Security must be incorporated into the system design and development process from the outset, with an emphasis on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Code Reviews and Static Analysis**: Code reviews and static analysis tools must be used to detect and mitigate security vulnerabilities early in the development process.
- **Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC)**: Implement practices such as threat modeling, secure coding standards, and regular security assessments throughout the SDLC.
- **Patch Management**: Ensure timely application of patches and updates to address known security vulnerabilities in the system or software.
- **Third-party Software Management**: All third-party software used in the development process must be assessed for security risks and compliance with organizational security standards.

**3.3 Risk Management**

- **Risk Assessment**: A risk assessment must be conducted during each SDLC phase to identify potential threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts to the system.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Risk mitigation strategies must be implemented to reduce identified risks to acceptable levels.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Systems must be continuously monitored for emerging threats, vulnerabilities, and performance issues.

**3.4 Documentation and Reporting**

- All SDLC phases must be documented, including requirements, designs, test results, and risk assessments.
- Documentation must be reviewed and approved by relevant stakeholders and management.
- Detailed reports must be created for each phase, outlining actions taken, issues identified, and resolutions implemented.

**3.5 Compliance and Standards**  
All systems must comply with applicable legal, regulatory, and organizational standards, including NIST 800-53, NIST 800-171, FISMA, GDPR, HIPAA, and other relevant frameworks.

**4\. Roles and Responsibilities**

**4.1 Project Manager**

- Oversee the SDLC process, ensuring that all phases are completed on time, within budget, and according to the required specifications.
- Ensure that security, risk management, and compliance requirements are integrated into the SDLC.

**4.2 Security Officer**

- Review and approve the security requirements and design of the system.
- Conduct risk assessments and ensure that security controls are in place and tested.
- Perform security audits and vulnerability assessments during the SDLC.

**4.3 Development Team**

- Follow secure coding standards and practices throughout the development process.
- Perform unit testing, peer reviews, and implement corrective actions for identified security vulnerabilities.
- Ensure that all system components are secure and compliant with policies.

**4.4 Quality Assurance (QA) Team**

- Perform thorough system testing, including functional, security, and performance tests.
- Document test results and assist in identifying and resolving any vulnerabilities or deficiencies in the system.

**4.5 IT Operations Team**

- Deploy and maintain the system in the production environment.
- Ensure the system is properly monitored, patched, and updated throughout its lifecycle.

**5\. Enforcement**  
Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary actions, including suspension of system development, termination of contracts, and revocation of access to development tools or environments. Non-compliance may also result in delays, increased risks, or security vulnerabilities in the developed systems.

**6\. Review and Revision**  
This policy shall be reviewed and updated annually or when significant changes are made to the SDLC process, technology, or regulatory requirements. Updates to the policy must be communicated to all stakeholders.
