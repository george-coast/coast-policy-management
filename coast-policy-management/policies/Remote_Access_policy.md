**Remote Access Policy**

**1\. Purpose**

The purpose of this Remote Access Policy is to define the requirements for secure remote access to the organization’s systems, networks, and data. This policy ensures that remote access is managed and monitored to protect against unauthorized access, in alignment with NIST 800-53 guidelines.

**2\. Scope**

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and other third parties who access the organization’s systems remotely. It covers access through Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), cloud platforms, and other remote access methods.

**3\. Policy Statement**

**3.1 Authorization and Access Control**

Remote access is permitted only for authorized users and must be approved by the appropriate manager and security team.

Access must be restricted to specific resources based on the user’s role and job responsibilities (principle of least privilege).

Privileged remote access (e.g., administrative accounts) must be explicitly approved and monitored.

**3.2 Secure Connection Requirements**

All remote access connections must use an approved and encrypted connection method, such as a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or Secure Shell (SSH).

Split tunneling is prohibited unless explicitly authorized by the security team.

All remote connections must be logged and monitored for suspicious activity.

**3.3 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

MFA is mandatory for all remote access connections to critical systems and sensitive data.

**3.4 Endpoint Security**

Devices used for remote access must meet the organization’s security requirements, including up-to-date antivirus software, firewalls, and patch management.

Only organization-owned or approved devices are permitted for remote access. Personal devices may require additional security controls and approval.

**3.5 Monitoring and Logging**

All remote access sessions must be logged, including user identity, connection time, and accessed resources.

Logs must be reviewed regularly to detect unauthorized or suspicious activity.

**3.6 Vendor and Third-Party Access**

Third-party vendors requiring remote access must sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and agree to adhere to the organization’s security policies.

Vendor access must be time-restricted, purpose-limited, and monitored.

**3.7 Remote Access Restrictions**

Remote access is prohibited for certain high-risk activities unless explicitly authorized and monitored.

Remote access to production systems must follow change control procedures and be documented.

**3.8 Termination of Access**

Remote access permissions must be revoked immediately upon employee termination, contract completion, or access no longer being required.

Inactive accounts with remote access capabilities must be disabled after 30 days.

**4\. Roles and Responsibilities**

**4.1 IT and Security Teams**

Implement and maintain secure remote access solutions.

Monitor and log all remote access activities.

Perform periodic reviews of remote access policies and configurations.

**4.2 Managers and Supervisors**

Approve remote access requests for their team members.

Ensure their team complies with this policy.

**4.3 All Users**

Use only authorized methods for remote access and report security incidents or policy violations immediately.

Ensure devices used for remote access are secure and compliant with organizational requirements.

**5\. Enforcement**

Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, termination of access privileges, and/or legal action.

**6\. Review and Revision**

This policy will be reviewed annually or after significant changes to systems, remote access technology, or regulatory requirements.
