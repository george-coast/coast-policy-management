**Risk Management Policy for Coast Autonomous Systems**

**1\. Purpose**

This policy establishes the framework for managing risks related to cybersecurity within Coast Autonomous Systems, in alignment with NIST 800-53, NIST 800-30, and other relevant standards. The objective is to ensure that risks are identified, assessed, framed, mitigated, and monitored to protect the organization's assets, systems, and data.

**2\. Scope**

This policy applies to all personnel, information systems, networks, and devices under the management of Coast Autonomous Systems, including external vendors and contractors. It encompasses operational, administrative, and technical controls to mitigate cybersecurity risks.

**3\. Risk Management Framework**

Coast’s Risk Management Framework is based on the principles of NIST 800-53 and NIST 800-30, emphasizing a comprehensive and structured approach to managing risks.

**3.1 Risk Framing**

The organization establishes the context for managing risks by:

- Defining the environment in which risk-based decisions are made.
- Articulating assumptions, constraints, and organizational priorities.
- Establishing transparency in risk perceptions for both investment and operational decisions.

The **Risk Management Strategy** includes:

1. Guidelines for assessing, responding to, and monitoring risks.
2. Organizational risk tolerance and thresholds for acceptable risks.
3. Methods for aligning risk decisions with mission and business processes.

**4\. Risk Assessment Process**

Coast employs a structured process to assess risks, as outlined in NIST 800-30:

1. **Threat Identification**:  
    Identify internal and external threats, including potential adversaries, natural events, and system failures.
2. **Vulnerability Assessment**:  
    Assess weaknesses in systems, networks, and controls that adversaries could exploit.
3. **Impact Analysis**:  
    Estimate the potential damage or loss from successful exploitation.
4. **Likelihood Determination**:  
    Assess the probability of threats exploiting vulnerabilities, using historical data and threat intelligence.
5. **Risk Determination**:  
    Combine likelihood and impact to evaluate the overall level of risk and determine its acceptability.

**5\. Risk Response**

The organization responds to risks based on assessments, ensuring consistent, organization-wide action:

1. Develop alternative courses of action for mitigating or accepting risks.
2. Evaluate each alternative based on organizational priorities and risk tolerance.
3. Select appropriate actions and implement mitigation measures.
4. Document responses in the **Risk Register** for accountability.

**6\. Risk Monitoring**

Coast continuously monitors risks to ensure mitigation strategies remain effective:

1. Evaluate the ongoing effectiveness of risk responses and controls.
2. Identify risk-impacting changes to information systems or their environments.
3. Verify that security requirements traceable to organizational missions, federal legislation, and policies are met.

Tools such as **Wazuh** and **Snort** support this process by identifying threats and alerting the Security Operations Center (SOC).

**7\. Integration with Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)**

Cybersecurity risk management activities are integrated into broader ERM processes, ensuring alignment with Coast’s organizational objectives. This integration is guided by NISTIR 8286A.

**8\. Use of a Risk Register**

The **Risk Register** serves as a central repository for:

- Identified risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.
- Likelihood and potential impact of each risk.
- Mitigation or remediation strategies.
- Risk status (e.g., accepted, mitigated, transferred).

**Risk Register Procedures:**

1. **Recording Risks**: All risks must be promptly recorded with full details.
2. **Regular Review**: The register will be reviewed quarterly or more frequently as required.
3. **Prioritization**: Risks are ranked based on potential impact and likelihood.
4. **Mitigation Planning**: Each risk will have documented strategies and assigned responsible parties.

**9\. Incident Response and Risk Integration**

Incident response procedures are integrated into the risk management framework. Detected incidents are evaluated for their impact on the organization’s risk profile, and the Risk Register is updated accordingly.

**10\. Roles and Responsibilities**

- **Risk Management Officer (RMO)**:  
    Oversees the implementation of the risk management framework and ensures compliance with NIST standards.
- **Information Security Team**:  
    Conducts risk assessments, implements controls, and maintains the Risk Register.
- **Incident Response Team (IRT)**:  
    Coordinates with the RMO to update the Risk Register following security incidents.

**11\. Compliance**

This policy aligns with the following NIST controls and standards:

- **NIST 800-53**:
  - RA-1: Risk Assessment Policy and Procedures
  - RA-2: Security Categorization
  - RA-3: Risk Assessment
  - RA-5: Vulnerability Scanning
  - IR-4: Incident Handling
- **NIST 800-30**:
  - Risk Assessment Guidance
- **NISTIR 8286A**:
  - Cybersecurity and ERM Integration
