**Assessment and Authorization Policy**

**1\. Purpose**  
The purpose of this policy is to define the process for assessing and authorizing information systems to ensure they operate securely, minimize risks, and comply with applicable regulations, including NIST 800-53.

**2\. Scope**  
This policy applies to all organizational systems, applications, and networks that store, process, or transmit organizational data. It covers both internal and third-party systems.

**3\. Policy Statement**

**3.1 System Assessment and Authorization Requirements**

- **Initial Assessment**: All new systems must undergo a security assessment before being authorized for operation.
- **Re-Assessment**: Systems must be reassessed annually or whenever significant changes to the system, environment, or data occur.
- **Authorization**: Systems must receive formal approval from the Authorizing Official (AO) before becoming operational.

**3.2 Security Assessment Objectives**

- Identify vulnerabilities in the system.
- Validate the effectiveness of implemented security controls.
- Ensure compliance with applicable regulations and standards.

**3.3 Authorization Process**  
The assessment and authorization process includes the following steps:

1. **System Categorization**: Determine the system’s impact level based on its confidentiality, integrity, and availability requirements.
2. **Control Selection and Implementation**: Select and implement security controls appropriate to the system’s categorization.
3. **Risk Assessment**: Conduct a risk assessment to identify and document risks associated with the system.
4. **Security Testing**: Perform security testing and vulnerability scans to verify control effectiveness.
5. **Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M)**: Develop a plan to address identified vulnerabilities.
6. **Authorization Decision**: The AO reviews the assessment results and determines whether to authorize, authorize with conditions, or deny system operation.

**3.4 Monitoring**

- Authorized systems must be continuously monitored to ensure security controls remain effective.
- Any unauthorized changes or detected vulnerabilities must be addressed immediately.

**3.5 Decommissioning**

- Systems that are no longer in use or fail to meet security requirements must be decommissioned and have their authorization revoked.

**4\. Roles and Responsibilities**

**4.1 Information System Owners (ISOs)**

- Ensure systems are properly categorized, documented, and assessed.
- Implement and maintain required security controls.

**4.2 Security Assessment Team**

- Conduct security testing and vulnerability scans.
- Prepare assessment reports detailing risks and recommendations.

**4.3 Authorizing Official (AO)**

- Review assessment reports and make authorization decisions.
- Monitor the risk profile of authorized systems.

**4.4 IT and Security Teams**

- Support system owners in implementing security controls.
- Monitor authorized systems for compliance and security incidents.

**5\. Enforcement**

- Systems that fail to meet assessment requirements or receive authorization cannot process, store, or transmit organizational data.
- Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, including removal of system access.

**6\. Review and Revision**  
This policy must be reviewed annually or whenever significant changes occur to the organization’s environment, systems, or regulatory requirements.
