**Data Destruction Policy**

**1\. Purpose**  
The purpose of this policy is to ensure that sensitive data is securely destroyed when no longer needed, in compliance with organizational, regulatory, and legal requirements. This policy defines the secure methods for data destruction to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to organizational data.

**2\. Scope**  
This policy applies to all data stored on any type of media or device, whether physical or digital. It includes, but is not limited to:

- Hard drives, solid-state drives, and other digital storage devices
- Optical media (e.g., CDs, DVDs)
- USB flash drives, external storage devices
- Paper documents, printed reports
- Backup tapes and other archival media
- Cloud storage and virtualized systems
- Data on mobile devices, laptops, and other portable electronics

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and any other individuals or entities that have access to organizational data.

**3\. Policy Statement**

**3.1 Data Destruction Requirements**

- Sensitive data should be destroyed as soon as it is no longer required for business operations, in accordance with the organization’s data retention policy.
- All data destruction procedures must ensure that data is irretrievable and cannot be reconstructed, recovered, or accessed.
- The destruction of data must comply with applicable laws, regulations, and contractual requirements, as well as organizational standards for data privacy and protection.
- Data destruction must be documented to ensure accountability and compliance with organizational policies.

**3.2 Data Destruction Methods**  
The following methods must be used for secure data destruction:

- **For Digital Data**:
  - **Data Overwriting**: Overwrite data on hard drives, solid-state drives, and other digital storage devices with random data multiple times to ensure that the original data is irretrievable.
  - **Degaussing**: Use degaussing (magnetic erasure) for magnetic media (e.g., hard drives, tapes) to destroy the magnetic field that holds the data.
  - **Physical Destruction**: Physically destroy media by crushing, shredding, or incinerating it, rendering the media and the data on it unusable and unrecoverable.
  - **Secure Data Deletion Software**: Use certified data destruction software that complies with industry standards (e.g., DoD 5220.22-M, NIST SP 800-88) for securely erasing data from devices such as computers, mobile devices, and cloud-based storage.
- **For Paper Documents**:
  - Shred paper documents containing sensitive data using a cross-cut shredder that ensures the data is unreadable and cannot be reconstructed.
  - Use third-party vendors for shredding services when required, ensuring that the vendor follows secure practices and provides a certificate of destruction.

**3.3 Data Destruction Timing**

- Data should be destroyed as soon as it is no longer needed for operational, legal, or regulatory purposes.
- Regular audits should be conducted to identify and destroy outdated or obsolete data that no longer serves a business or legal purpose.
- Backup data and archived data should be destroyed according to the same standards, once retention requirements have been met.

**3.4 Media Destruction**

- All storage media (hard drives, solid-state drives, optical media, backup tapes, etc.) that has reached the end of its useful life or is no longer required for business operations must be securely destroyed following the appropriate destruction method.
- The destruction of storage media should be tracked and logged, with a certificate of destruction issued for all destroyed media.

**3.5 Cloud Data Destruction**

- For cloud-based storage, ensure that any sensitive data is securely deleted according to the cloud provider’s data destruction policies.
- The organization must confirm that the cloud provider’s data destruction practices meet or exceed organizational standards and compliance requirements.
- Where necessary, encryption keys should also be destroyed to render any data unrecoverable.

**3.6 Vendor Management for Data Destruction**

- When outsourcing data destruction to third-party vendors, ensure that the vendor complies with the organization’s data destruction policies and industry standards.
- Vendor contracts should include provisions for data security, destruction procedures, and documentation of destruction.
- The organization should obtain certificates of destruction from vendors, detailing the type of media destroyed, the method of destruction, and the date of destruction.

**3.7 Documentation and Verification**

- All data destruction activities must be thoroughly documented. Documentation should include:
  - The type of data destroyed
  - The method of destruction used
  - The date of destruction
  - The identity of the personnel performing the destruction
  - Any certificates or proof of destruction, including vendor certificates
- Periodic audits should be conducted to verify that data destruction procedures are being followed correctly.

**3.8 Reporting and Incident Management**

- Any failure to securely destroy data must be reported immediately to the appropriate personnel (e.g., IT security, legal, compliance teams).
- A risk assessment should be conducted in the event of a failure in the data destruction process to determine potential impacts and corrective actions.
- Data destruction incidents should be documented and reviewed as part of the organization’s continuous improvement process.

**4\. Roles and Responsibilities**

**4.1 IT Security Team**

- Establish and enforce secure data destruction standards and procedures.
- Oversee the implementation of data destruction processes across the organization.
- Ensure the use of certified data destruction methods and tools.
- Conduct audits to verify the proper destruction of sensitive data.

**4.2 Data Custodians**

- Ensure the secure destruction of data under their care, following the applicable standards and policies.
- Ensure the appropriate method of destruction is used for the specific type of data and media.

**4.3 Employees and Contractors**

- Follow the organization’s data destruction procedures when handling sensitive data or media.
- Report any incidents related to the improper destruction of data immediately to the IT security team.

**5\. Training and Awareness**

- All employees must be trained on the importance of secure data destruction and the organization’s policies and procedures for destroying sensitive data.
- IT staff and data custodians must receive specialized training on the tools and methods used for secure data destruction.
- Periodic refresher training should be provided to ensure that employees are up to date on best practices and any changes to the policy.

**6\. Enforcement**  
Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, including but not limited to restricted access to organizational systems, reassignment of duties, or termination of employment.

**7\. Review and Revision**  
This policy will be reviewed annually or whenever there are significant changes in technology, regulations, or legal requirements. Updates to this policy will be communicated to all relevant stakeholders.
