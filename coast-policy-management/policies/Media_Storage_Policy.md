**Media Storage Policy**

**1\. Purpose**  
The purpose of this policy is to establish requirements for the secure storage of sensitive data on media, whether physical or digital. This policy aims to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data during its storage phase, ensuring that it is protected from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction.

**2\. Scope**  
This policy applies to all forms of media used for storing organizational data, including:

- Physical media (e.g., hard drives, solid-state drives, backup tapes, CDs, DVDs, USB drives)
- Digital media (e.g., cloud storage, network-attached storage, servers)
- Backup media and archival data
- Any other device or medium that may contain sensitive or confidential information

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, third-party vendors, and any other individuals or entities with access to organizational data.

**3\. Policy Statement**

**3.1 Media Storage Requirements**

- All media containing sensitive data must be stored in secure, controlled environments to protect it from unauthorized access, tampering, or theft.
- Access to storage areas for media containing sensitive data must be restricted to authorized personnel only.
- All media containing sensitive data must be protected by encryption, both at rest and in transit, when applicable.
- Media containing sensitive data should be regularly monitored for compliance with organizational security standards.

**3.2 Physical Storage**

- **Locked Storage**: Physical media containing sensitive data should be stored in secure, locked environments, such as locked file cabinets, safes, or secure server rooms, with restricted access.
- **Access Control**: Only authorized personnel should have access to media storage areas. Access should be controlled using physical security measures (e.g., keycards, biometric authentication).
- **Environment**: The storage environment should be climate-controlled to protect media from physical damage (e.g., heat, humidity, dust).
- **Separation of Media**: Media containing highly sensitive or classified data should be stored separately from less-sensitive media to further limit the exposure of sensitive data.

**3.3 Digital Storage**

- **Encryption**: Digital media containing sensitive data should be encrypted using strong encryption methods (e.g., AES-256) to prevent unauthorized access in the event of theft or data leakage.
- **Access Control**: Digital storage locations (e.g., cloud storage, file servers) should be protected by strong access control mechanisms, such as role-based access control (RBAC), multi-factor authentication (MFA), and strong passwords.
- **Network Protection**: Data stored digitally should be protected from network threats through firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and secure network protocols (e.g., HTTPS, VPNs).
- **Cloud Storage**: When using cloud storage, ensure that the cloud provider implements strong security measures, such as encryption, access controls, and data redundancy, to protect sensitive data.

**3.4 Backup and Archival Media Storage**

- **Offsite Storage**: Backup media should be stored offsite in a secure location to protect against local disasters (e.g., fires, floods).
- **Secure Transfer**: When transporting backup or archival media, it must be done in a secure manner, such as using encrypted communication channels or physical security measures to prevent unauthorized access during transit.
- **Retention Periods**: Backup and archival media must be retained in accordance with the organization’s data retention policy, with the data securely destroyed once it is no longer needed.

**3.5 Media Labeling and Inventory Management**

- **Labeling**: All media should be clearly labeled with identifying information (e.g., media type, data classification level, retention period) to ensure proper handling and security.
- **Inventory Management**: A media inventory management system should be implemented to track the location, status, and ownership of all media containing sensitive data. This should include both physical and digital media.
- **Audit Logs**: A logging system should be implemented to track the access and movement of media, ensuring accountability and traceability.

**3.6 Access Control and Accountability**

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Media containing sensitive data should be subject to role-based access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to the data stored on the media.
- **Monitoring and Auditing**: Access to media storage areas, both physical and digital, should be continuously monitored and logged to detect any unauthorized access attempts. Regular audits should be conducted to ensure compliance with security policies.
- **Access Logs**: Any access to media containing sensitive data, including digital media, should be logged and reviewed regularly. Logs should capture details such as the user accessing the media, the time of access, and the nature of the access.

**3.7 Media Handling and Transportation**

- **Secure Handling**: All media should be handled with care to prevent unauthorized access or physical damage. Physical media should not be left unattended in unsecured areas.
- **Secure Transportation**: When transporting media, physical or digital, ensure that it is securely packaged and transported using trusted, secure methods.
- **Temporary Storage**: When media is temporarily stored in transit or in a non-permanent location, it should be protected using encryption, access controls, and physical security measures.

**3.8 Periodic Review and Disposal**

- **Review**: Periodically review the storage and security of all media to ensure compliance with this policy and applicable regulations.
- **Disposal**: When media is no longer needed, it should be securely disposed of according to the organization’s **Data Destruction Policy**, ensuring that any sensitive data cannot be recovered.

**4\. Roles and Responsibilities**

**4.1 IT Security Team**

- Implement and enforce this Media Storage Policy.
- Ensure the secure storage and protection of media containing sensitive data.
- Monitor and audit media storage areas and inventory systems for compliance.
- Oversee the encryption, access control, and backup systems for digital media.

**4.2 Data Custodians**

- Ensure that data is securely stored on appropriate media in accordance with the organization’s security policies.
- Maintain accurate inventories of all media containing sensitive data.
- Ensure that sensitive data is encrypted, and access controls are applied to media storage.

**4.3 Employees and Contractors**

- Follow media storage and handling procedures to ensure the security of sensitive data.
- Report any unauthorized access to media storage or mishandling of media immediately to the IT security team.

**5\. Training and Awareness**

- All employees must be trained on the organization’s media storage policies and procedures.
- IT staff and data custodians must receive specialized training on securing media storage and ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulations.
- Periodic refresher training should be provided to keep staff informed of best practices and any updates to the policy.

**6\. Enforcement**  
Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, including but not limited to revocation of access to sensitive data, reassignment of duties, or termination of employment.

**7\. Review and Revision**  
This policy will be reviewed annually or whenever significant changes in technology, laws, or business needs occur. Updates to this policy will be communicated to all relevant personnel.
