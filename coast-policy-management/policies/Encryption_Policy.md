**Encryption Policy**

**1\. Purpose**  
The purpose of this Encryption Policy is to define the requirements for the use of encryption to protect sensitive information both at rest and in transit within the organization. This policy ensures that data is adequately protected from unauthorized access, theft, or exposure, consistent with security and compliance requirements.

**2\. Scope**  
This policy applies to all systems, devices, applications, and personnel handling sensitive data within the organization. It covers data stored on physical devices (at rest) and data transmitted across networks (in transit). This policy also applies to third-party service providers who manage or store the organization’s data.

**3\. Policy Statement**

**3.1 Data Encryption Requirements**

- **Data at Rest**:  
    All sensitive data stored on organization-owned servers, storage devices, and backup media must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256). This applies to databases, file systems, backups, and any other data repositories.
- **Data in Transit**:  
    All sensitive data transmitted over networks must be encrypted to protect it during transit. Encryption protocols such as **Transport Layer Security (TLS)** or **openvpn** must be used for communication across public and private networks. Data transferred over unsecured channels (e.g., email, HTTP) should be protected using encryption technologies. **Email encryption (PGP, S/MIME) must be enabled** for transmitting sensitive emails. **SSH and OpenVPN connections must require MFA** and use strong cryptographic settings. **Legacy insecure protocols (e.g., SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, FTP, Telnet) are prohibited.**

**3.2 Encryption Standards**

- **Encryption Algorithms**:  
    The organization will use encryption algorithms approved by NIST, including but not limited to AES-256 for data at rest and TLS 1.2 or higher for data in transit. The use of proprietary or weak encryption algorithms is prohibited unless explicitly approved by the organization’s security team.
- **Key Management**:  
    Encryption keys must be generated, distributed, and stored securely. Key management processes will follow NIST SP 800-57, including:
  - Keys must be protected against unauthorized access.
  - Keys must be rotated regularly, at least annually or after any suspected compromise.
  - Key storage solutions must meet strict security standards (e.g., hardware security modules (HSMs)).
  - Encryption keys must be generated using FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules.
  - **Key revocation and destruction** must follow NIST SP 800-57 guidelines.

**3.3 Sensitive Data Definition**

Sensitive data includes, but is not limited to:

- Personally identifiable information (PII)
- Payment card information (PCI)
- Protected health information (PHI)
- Financial records
- Confidential business data

Any data classified as "sensitive" must be encrypted both at rest and in transit.

**3.4 Data Encryption in Cloud Environments**  
When storing or transmitting sensitive data in cloud environments, the organization must ensure that encryption is enforced through both the cloud provider’s encryption mechanisms and the organization's own encryption policies. Encryption keys should be managed in accordance with the organization’s key management processes, with the cloud provider's security offerings evaluated for compliance.

**3.5 Encryption for Mobile Devices and Removable Media**  
Encryption is required for all organization-issued mobile devices, laptops, and removable media (e.g., USB drives, external hard drives) that store sensitive data. Full disk encryption or file-level encryption must be implemented to protect data in case of theft or loss.

**3.6 Data Deletion and Destruction**  
Before sensitive data is deleted or decommissioned from systems or devices, it must be securely erased using industry-standard techniques (e.g., cryptographic erasure). If physical destruction of storage devices is necessary, it must be done according to the organization’s media sanitization policy.

**3.7 Use of Encryption for Application Development**  
Software applications that store, process, or transmit sensitive data must integrate encryption controls where appropriate. Developers must use secure encryption libraries and adhere to secure coding practices to prevent exposure of sensitive data.

**3.8 Third-Party Data Storage and Transmission**  
When data is transferred to or stored by third-party vendors, the organization must ensure that the third party complies with encryption requirements similar to those outlined in this policy. The use of encryption must be explicitly stated in contracts and service level agreements (SLAs).

**3.9 Exception Management**  
Any exceptions to this policy must be formally approved by the organization’s information security team and documented with justification. Exceptions must be limited in scope, duration, and impact, and appropriate mitigating controls should be in place.

**4\. Roles and Responsibilities**

- **Information Security Team**: Responsible for overseeing encryption practices, ensuring compliance with this policy, and providing guidance on encryption standards.
- **System Administrators**: Responsible for implementing and maintaining encryption for data at rest and in transit, including key management practices.
- **Software Development Teams**: Responsible for integrating encryption into applications and ensuring that sensitive data is encrypted throughout its lifecycle.
- **Employees**: Responsible for ensuring that sensitive data is encrypted when handled, stored, or transmitted in accordance with this policy.

**5\. Enforcement**  
Non-compliance with this policy may result in disciplinary action, including termination, depending on the severity of the violation. Failure to encrypt sensitive data may expose the organization to security breaches and legal liabilities. Unauthorized access or mishandling of encryption keys may result in severe consequences, including legal penalties and reputational damage.

**6\. Documentation and Recordkeeping**  
The organization will maintain records of encryption implementation and key management practices. This includes documentation on encryption algorithms used, key rotation schedules, exception requests, and third-party encryption arrangements.

**7\. Review and Revision**  
This policy will be reviewed annually or as needed in response to changes in technology or regulations. Changes will be made to ensure that encryption practices continue to meet industry standards and compliance requirements.
