**Incident Response (IR) Plan**

**1\. Overview & Scope**

This Incident Response (IR) Plan is designed to align with NIST 800-53 and applies to all systems within the organization's IT environment. The goal is to provide structured response procedures for cybersecurity incidents, ensuring rapid containment, mitigation, and recovery.

**1.1 Systems Covered**

- **Wazuh (SIEM):** Monitors system logs and alerts on security anomalies.
- **JumpCloud (IAM & Password Manager Logs):** Manages authentication and access control.
- **pfSense (Firewall with Snort IDS/IPS):** Monitors and protects network traffic.
- **GitHub Actions (CI/CD Security):** Ensures secure development pipelines.
- **Ubuntu 22.04 Servers:** Hosts Wazuh and critical services.
- **Arkime + Snort:** Monitors the VPN network that is used to connect the largo network to arm vehicles
- **Autonomous Vehicle Systems:** Includes RTMap, robotic function controllers, location services, and AWS ECS Supervisor System.

**2\. Incident Categories & Classification**

Incidents are categorized based on severity and impact:

| **Category** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Unauthorized Access** | Unauthorized login attempts, credential compromise, or privilege escalation. |
| **Malware & Exploits** | Malware detection, zero-day exploit attempts, or unusual system behavior. |
| **Data Breach** | Unauthorized access to sensitive data or exfiltration attempts. |
| **Network Intrusions** | Unusual network activity, unauthorized access attempts, or DDoS attacks. |

**3\. Detection & Identification**

**3.1 Wazuh SIEM Alerts**

- Monitor JumpCloud password manager logs for anomalous activity.
- Analyze triggered Wazuh rules and investigate alerts via Kibana dashboards.

**3.2 Snort IDS Alerts (pfSense)**

- Investigate flagged traffic patterns such as ICMP tunneling or brute-force attempts.

**3.3 System Logs & Cron Jobs**

- Review daily log copies generated by cron jobs for inconsistencies or anomalies.

**4\. Containment & Eradication Steps**

**4.1 Unauthorized Access (JumpCloud, SSH, VPN, GitHub, etc.)**

- Disable affected user accounts.
- Review and revoke API keys or OAuth tokens.
- Reset affected passwords and enforce MFA.

**4.2 Network Intrusions (Snort, Wazuh, pfSense)**

- Block malicious IPs on the pfSense firewall.
- Investigate Wazuh event logs for lateral movement.

**4.3 Malware or Exploits**

- Isolate affected servers.
- Use netstat, ps aux, and top to analyze processes and network connections.
- Run endpoint security scans and remove infected files.

**5\. Recovery & Lessons Learned**

**5.1 System Recovery**

- Restore affected systems from backups.
- Verify the integrity of data and services before bringing systems back online.

**5.2 Security Enhancements**

- Update firewall rules and SIEM alert policies to prevent recurrence.
- Apply security patches and system updates.

**5.3 Post-Incident Analysis**

- Conduct a root cause analysis.
- Document findings in Jira Service Management for tracking.
- Update this IR plan based on lessons learned.

**6\. Incident Communication Plan**

**6.1 Internal Notification**

- Notify security team members and system administrators.
- Escalate incidents based on severity.

**6.2 External Reporting**

- Report security incidents to regulatory authorities as required.
- Notify affected stakeholders if personal data is involved.

**7\. System-Specific Incident Response Playbooks**

**7.1 JumpCloud Incident Response Playbook**

**Threat Scenarios**

| **Incident Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Compromised Admin Account** | Unauthorized login to admin account |
| **Brute-Force Login Attempts** | Repeated failed login attempts from unknown IPs |
| **API Key Leak** | Exposed API keys for automated scripts |

**Detection Methods**

- **Wazuh SIEM logs** â€“ Monitor jumpcloud_authentication.log for unusual login attempts.
- **JumpCloud Alerts** â€“ Configure alerts for failed logins, MFA bypass, or new API key creations.
- **GeoIP Analysis** â€“ Flag login attempts from unusual locations.

**Response Steps**

ðŸš¨ **For Compromised Admin Account**

1. Disable the affected admin account in JumpCloud.
2. Verify recent changes using the **JumpCloud event logs**.
3. Force password reset & enforce **MFA**.

ðŸš¨ **For Brute-Force Login Attempts**

1. Identify the source IP from logs.
2. Block the IP at the **firewall**.
3. Investigate if any accounts were compromised.

ðŸš¨ **For API Key Leak**

1. Revoke the compromised API key immediately.
2. Check if any unauthorized API calls were made.
3. Rotate API keys and enforce least privilege.

**7.2 Autonomous Vehicle Systems Playbook**

**Threat Scenarios**

| **Incident Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **GPS Spoofing Attack** | False GPS signals misleading vehicle location services. |
| **Compromised Robotic Function System** | Unauthorized access or command injection affecting vehicle operation. |
| **AWS ECS Supervisor Breach** | Unauthorized administrative access affecting fleet-wide operations. |

**Detection Methods**

- **Location Anomaly Detection** â€“ Monitor deviations between reported and expected GPS data.
- **System Integrity Checks** â€“ Validate software running on robotic function controllers.
- **AWS CloudWatch & GuardDuty Alerts** â€“ Detect suspicious activities in the cloud environment.

**Response Steps**

ðŸš¨ **For GPS Spoofing Attack**

1. Switch to secondary location verification methods (sensor fusion, onboard maps).
2. Issue an emergency stop command if necessary.
3. Identify spoofing source and mitigate as possible.

ðŸš¨ **For Compromised Robotic Function System**

1. Isolate affected vehicles from network and halt operations.
2. Perform forensic analysis on logs and firmware.
3. Restore to a well-known safe software version.

ðŸš¨ **For AWS ECS Supervisor Breach**

1. Revoke compromised IAM credentials immediately.
2. Investigate AWS CloudTrail logs for unauthorized actions.
3. Rotate affected secrets and enforce access controls.

ðŸš¨ **For Ethernet Kill Switch Activation & Out-of-Band Communications**

1. Activate the **Ethernet kill switch** to disconnect compromised systems.
2. Utilize **out-of-band communication channels** to coordinate the response securely.
3. Restore secure connections only after forensic analysis is complete.
