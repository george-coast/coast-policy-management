**Insider Threat Policy**

**1\. Purpose**  
The purpose of the Insider Threat Policy is to establish the organization’s approach to identifying, managing, and mitigating risks associated with insider threats. An insider threat refers to individuals within the organization, such as employees, contractors, or partners, who may intentionally or unintentionally misuse their access to sensitive systems, data, or resources, causing harm to the organization’s assets, reputation, or operational integrity.

**2\. Scope**  
This policy applies to all personnel within the organization, including employees, contractors, consultants, third-party vendors, and any other individual with authorized access to the organization's information systems, networks, or physical facilities.

**3\. Policy Statement**

**3.1 Definition of Insider Threat**  
An insider threat can take several forms, including, but not limited to:

- **Malicious Insider Threats**: Individuals who intentionally misuse their access to cause harm to the organization, such as data theft, sabotage, or fraud.
- **Negligent Insider Threats**: Individuals who unintentionally cause harm due to carelessness, lack of awareness, or failure to follow security protocols (e.g., sending sensitive information to the wrong recipient, losing an unencrypted device, or falling victim to phishing attacks).
- **Compromised Insider Threats**: Individuals whose access is exploited by external attackers (e.g., through social engineering or credential theft).

**3.2 Risk Mitigation and Prevention**  
The organization takes a proactive approach to preventing and mitigating insider threats through a combination of preventive, detective, and corrective controls, including:

- **Access Control**: Limit access to sensitive information and systems to those with a legitimate business need, using the principle of least privilege. Employ role-based access control (RBAC) and enforce strong authentication methods.
- **Employee Screening**: Conduct background checks on employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who will have access to sensitive data or systems. The screening process will include criminal background checks, employment history verification, and credit history (where applicable).
- **Security Awareness Training**: Ensure all personnel are trained on identifying and mitigating insider threats. Training should cover topics such as data protection, identifying phishing attempts, securing devices, and reporting suspicious activity.
- **Behavioral Monitoring**: Monitor user behavior, including system access patterns, file movements, and communication logs, to detect anomalies that could indicate insider threats. Automated tools may be employed to assist in monitoring and flagging unusual activity.
- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**: Implement DLP systems to monitor and prevent unauthorized access to, or transmission of, sensitive data. These systems will help identify potential data breaches and prevent the misuse of confidential information.

**3.3 Incident Detection and Response**  
To ensure a prompt response to potential insider threats, the organization will:

- **Security Monitoring**: Continuously monitor internal systems and networks for abnormal activity that could indicate insider threats. This includes monitoring for unauthorized data transfers, attempts to access restricted areas, or unusual login times.
- **Incident Reporting**: Encourage personnel to report suspicious activities or security breaches immediately to designated personnel, such as security officers or managers. Employees should feel confident that reports will be handled confidentially and without retaliation.
- **Incident Response Plan**: Develop and maintain an incident response plan specifically for handling insider threat incidents. The plan will include protocols for detecting, investigating, containing, and remediating insider threats, as well as notifying relevant stakeholders.
- **Forensics and Investigation**: In the event of an insider threat, conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the scope of the breach, the parties involved, and the impact on the organization. This may include reviewing system logs, email exchanges, and other digital evidence.

**3.4 Corrective Action and Disciplinary Measures**  
Any personnel found to have engaged in malicious or negligent behavior that compromises the organization’s security or data integrity will be subject to corrective actions, including:

- **Disciplinary Action**: Depending on the severity of the incident, corrective actions may include suspension, demotion, reassignment, or termination of employment or contract.
- **Legal Action**: If the insider threat involves illegal activities, such as theft or fraud, the organization may pursue legal action, including reporting the individual to law enforcement and seeking restitution for damages caused by their actions.
- **Rehabilitation and Remediation**: For negligent insiders, the organization will provide opportunities for education and remediation, including additional training and counseling, to prevent future incidents.

**3.5 Monitoring and Reporting**  
The organization will maintain a system of continuous monitoring to identify potential insider threats and ensure compliance with this policy. Monitoring will include:

- **Audit Logs**: Maintain comprehensive and secure audit logs of all user activity on critical systems. Logs should include system access times, file transfers, changes to sensitive data, and any suspicious activities.
- **Periodic Audits**: Conduct regular audits of user access, system logs, and data movements to identify any potential risks or violations. Audits should be performed by independent security personnel to ensure objectivity.
- **Reporting of Insider Threats**: Require periodic reports on insider threat risks and incidents to senior management and the board of directors. These reports should include statistics on detected incidents, investigations, and corrective actions taken.

**3.6 Employee and Contractor Responsibilities**  
All employees and contractors are expected to:

- Comply with the organization’s security policies, including those that pertain to insider threat prevention.
- Report any suspicious behavior or potential security threats to the appropriate authorities.
- Follow secure handling practices for sensitive data and intellectual property.
- Maintain awareness of the risks associated with insider threats and take steps to protect the organization’s assets and information.

**4\. Roles and Responsibilities**

- **Security Team**: Responsible for implementing monitoring and detection systems, investigating insider threats, and coordinating incident response efforts.
- **HR Department**: Works closely with the security team to ensure that background checks are performed and that personnel receive appropriate training on insider threats.
- **Line Managers**: Responsible for monitoring the behavior of employees and contractors under their supervision and for reporting any suspicious activities.
- **Legal Department**: Provides guidance on the legal implications of insider threat incidents, including any required disclosures to authorities.
- **All Employees**: Responsible for adhering to security policies, reporting potential threats, and maintaining confidentiality.

**5\. Enforcement**  
Any violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract. Additionally, legal action may be pursued if the violation involves criminal activity. The organization will enforce this policy rigorously to protect its assets and ensure the safety and security of its information systems.

**6\. Documentation and Recordkeeping**  
Records related to insider threat incidents, investigations, and actions taken should be documented and retained in accordance with organizational policies for record retention. Documentation should be securely stored and accessible for auditing, legal compliance, and future reference.

**7\. Review and Revision**  
This policy will be reviewed and updated annually to ensure its effectiveness in mitigating insider threats. Changes may be made as necessary to address emerging threats, regulatory changes, and improvements in monitoring technology.
