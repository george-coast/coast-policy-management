**Facility Access Policy**

**1\. Purpose**  
The purpose of this policy is to define the processes and requirements for granting, managing, and revoking access to organizational facilities to safeguard against unauthorized access, theft, or damage. This policy aims to ensure that only authorized individuals have access to secure areas and that access is controlled based on the principle of least privilege.

**2\. Scope**  
This policy applies to all individuals who require access to organizational facilities, including:

- Employees, contractors, and consultants
- Vendors and service providers
- Visitors (temporary or regular)

This policy covers all areas within the facility, including secure areas, server rooms, and other locations containing sensitive or critical assets.

**3\. Policy Statement**

**3.1 Access Control**

- Access to organizational facilities shall be granted based on the principle of least privilege. Only those who need to perform their job functions in specific areas shall be given access.
- Access to sensitive areas, such as server rooms, data centers, and administrative offices, shall be restricted to authorized personnel only.
- The organization shall implement a formal process for granting, reviewing, and revoking access to facilities. This process must include verifying the identity and purpose of individuals requesting access.

**3.2 Access Request and Approval**

- **Request Process**: Employees and contractors requiring access to specific areas must submit a request to the designated security officer or facility manager.
- **Approval Process**: Access requests must be reviewed and approved by authorized personnel based on the requester’s role, function, and need for access.
- **Access Type**: Access may be temporary or permanent. Temporary access for contractors and visitors shall have defined start and end dates and be limited to specific areas relevant to their work.
- **Role-Based Access**: Access to certain areas will be granted based on job roles. For example, personnel in IT or facilities management may be granted access to server rooms, while HR staff may access employee records but not server rooms.

**3.3 Access Methods**

- **Physical Access Control**: The organization shall utilize access control mechanisms such as key cards, biometric systems, or PIN codes to restrict access to authorized individuals.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: All access to secure areas shall be logged. Logs shall record the identity of individuals accessing the facility, the time and date of access, and the area accessed. These logs must be reviewed periodically for compliance and to identify any unauthorized access attempts.
- **Key and Badge Management**: The organization shall maintain a system for issuing and tracking keys, access badges, and other physical access credentials. Lost or stolen keys or badges must be reported immediately and may result in the rekeying or deactivation of locks.
- **Access Revocation**: Access to facilities shall be revoked immediately when an individual no longer requires access, such as when an employee leaves the organization or a contractor's work is completed.

**3.4 Visitor Access**

- **Visitor Registration**: Visitors must sign in upon arrival, providing identification and the purpose of their visit. Visitors shall be issued temporary access badges, which must be worn at all times while in the facility.
- **Escorting Visitors**: All visitors must be escorted by authorized personnel while in secure areas of the facility.
- **Visitor Areas**: Access for visitors shall be limited to non-sensitive areas unless prior approval has been obtained.
- **Visitor Log**: A visitor log shall be maintained, including the visitor's name, the date and time of entry and exit, the areas accessed, and the name of the host.

**3.5 Employee and Contractor Access**

- **Employee Access**: Employees shall be granted access to areas required for the performance of their job duties. This access will be periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary.
- **Contractor Access**: Contractors shall only be granted access to the specific areas and for the duration necessary to complete their work. Contractors’ access must be approved by the relevant department or security personnel, and they shall be accompanied by authorized personnel in secure areas.
- **Background Checks**: Employees, contractors, and vendors requiring access to sensitive areas or systems shall undergo background checks as part of the onboarding or access approval process.

**3.6 Temporary Access and Exceptions**

- **Temporary Access**: Temporary access may be granted to employees, contractors, or vendors who require short-term entry to secure areas. Temporary access shall be limited in scope, duration, and frequency and must be requested and approved in advance.
- **Exceptions**: Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by senior management or the security officer. Such exceptions must be justified by operational needs, with compensating controls put in place to mitigate the risks associated with the exception.

**3.7 Revocation of Access**

- **Termination of Employment or Contract**: When an employee or contractor leaves the organization, their access to facilities shall be immediately revoked. This includes retrieval of access badges, keys, or any other credentials.
- **Non-Compliance or Security Violations**: Access may be revoked for employees, contractors, or visitors who violate security policies or fail to follow established procedures.
- **Change in Role**: If an employee's job role changes and the new role does not require access to previously granted areas, access shall be adjusted accordingly.
- **Notification of Access Changes**: Any changes to access rights (granting, modification, or revocation) shall be promptly communicated to the affected individual and relevant departments.

**3.8 Security Monitoring and Surveillance**

- **Access Monitoring**: All access to secure areas shall be continuously monitored through physical security systems, such as surveillance cameras and access control logs.
- **Suspicious Activity**: Any suspicious activity, such as unauthorized access attempts or attempts to bypass security controls, must be reported immediately to security personnel for investigation.
- **Incident Response**: In the event of a physical security incident, such as unauthorized access or theft, the organization shall follow established incident response procedures.

**3.9 Facility Access Review**

- **Periodic Reviews**: Access rights to facilities shall be reviewed on a regular basis, at least annually, to ensure that only authorized individuals retain access to secure areas.
- **Audit Logs**: Access control logs shall be regularly audited to detect any unauthorized or unusual access patterns.

**4\. Roles and Responsibilities**

**4.1 Facility Manager**

- Oversee the implementation of the Facility Access Policy and ensure the security of all physical access control systems.
- Approve or deny access requests based on role requirements and job responsibilities.
- Ensure that all access control mechanisms are functioning properly and perform regular security audits.

**4.2 Security Personnel**

- Monitor access control logs and video surveillance for unusual or unauthorized access.
- Respond to security incidents involving unauthorized access or violations of facility access procedures.
- Assist with conducting periodic access reviews and audits.

**4.3 Employees and Contractors**

- Follow all facility access procedures, including checking in with security upon arrival and reporting any suspicious activity.
- Safeguard their access credentials and report any loss or theft immediately.
- Adhere to any restrictions regarding the areas they are permitted to access.

**5\. Enforcement**  
Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contracts. Security violations, including unauthorized access or failure to follow access procedures, may lead to immediate revocation of access and further investigation.

**6\. Review and Revision**  
This policy shall be reviewed annually, or whenever significant changes to the organization’s physical access requirements or security systems occur. Updates to the policy shall be communicated to all relevant personnel.
