**Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) Policy**

**1\. Purpose**  
The purpose of this Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) Policy is to establish a framework for identifying, assessing, and mitigating privacy risks associated with the collection, use, storage, sharing, and disposal of personal data. The PIA ensures compliance with privacy regulations, such as the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**, the **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**, and other applicable laws, and promotes responsible data handling practices across the organization.

**2\. Scope**  
This policy applies to all systems, processes, and projects involving the collection, processing, or storage of personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive data across the organization. It covers both electronic and physical records and applies to:

- Internal systems and applications
- Third-party services and contractors
- Cloud-based platforms
- Business processes or workflows involving personal data

**3\. Policy Statement**

**3.1 Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) Requirement**  
A Privacy Impact Assessment must be conducted in the following situations:

- When developing or implementing a new information system, application, or service that involves the collection or processing of PII.
- When making changes to an existing system or application that may affect the privacy of individuals or their data.
- When engaging with third-party vendors or partners to process or manage PII on behalf of the organization.
- When creating or modifying processes, policies, or procedures that may have an impact on privacy.

**3.2 Conducting the Privacy Impact Assessment**  
The PIA will assess the privacy risks and impacts of any new or modified system, project, or service, including:

- **Data Collection**: What personal data will be collected, and how will it be collected?
- **Data Use**: How will the collected data be used and for what purpose?
- **Data Retention**: How long will personal data be stored, and what is the retention schedule?
- **Data Sharing**: Who will have access to the data, and how will it be shared with third parties or vendors?
- **Data Security**: What measures will be taken to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of personal data?
- **Data Disposal**: How will personal data be securely deleted or anonymized when no longer needed?

**3.3 Privacy Risk Assessment**  
The PIA will include a risk assessment to identify and evaluate the privacy risks associated with the system, process, or project. The risks should be categorized into the following:

- **High Risk**: Activities that could cause significant harm to individuals' privacy or data protection rights.
- **Medium Risk**: Activities that could cause moderate harm to individuals' privacy or data protection rights.
- **Low Risk**: Activities that pose a minimal risk to individuals' privacy or data protection rights.

**3.4 Mitigation of Privacy Risks**  
For identified privacy risks, the organization will develop and implement mitigation strategies. These may include:

- Reducing the amount of data collected or processing only the data necessary for the stated purpose (data minimization).
- Implementing stronger security measures such as encryption or access controls.
- Providing transparency and clear consent mechanisms for individuals whose data is being collected.
- Establishing data retention and disposal policies that ensure personal data is kept only for as long as necessary.
- Ensuring third-party vendors are compliant with the organizationâ€™s privacy policies through contracts and regular audits.

**3.5 Documentation and Reporting**

- **PIA Report**: A detailed report documenting the findings of the PIA, including the potential privacy risks, mitigation measures, and recommendations for compliance. The report will be submitted to senior management and stakeholders for review and approval.
- **Record Retention**: PIA documentation will be retained for a minimum of **5 years** or as required by law or regulation.
- **Ongoing Monitoring**: Following the completion of the PIA, the organization will monitor the system or project to ensure that privacy risks are continuously managed. If changes occur, a re-assessment will be performed.

**3.6 Third-Party Assessments**  
When using third-party vendors or service providers to process or manage personal data, a privacy impact assessment will be conducted as part of the vendor risk management process. Third parties must comply with the organization's privacy requirements and security controls, and their practices must be evaluated to ensure compliance with privacy laws.

**4\. Roles and Responsibilities**

- **Data Privacy Officer (DPO)**:  
    The Data Privacy Officer (DPO) is responsible for overseeing the implementation of this policy, ensuring that PIAs are conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements, and reviewing the PIA reports for accuracy and completeness.
- **Project Owners**:  
    Project or system owners are responsible for initiating the PIA process when a new project, system, or service is being developed, or an existing one is being modified. They must ensure that all necessary privacy risk factors are considered and addressed.
- **IT/Security Team**:  
    The IT/Security team supports the PIA process by providing technical expertise on data security measures, ensuring that privacy risks are mitigated through appropriate controls, and assisting with the implementation of security technologies (such as encryption and access controls).
- **Legal and Compliance Teams**:  
    The legal and compliance teams are responsible for ensuring that all privacy regulations and laws are considered during the PIA process, helping to assess the organization's legal obligations, and ensuring compliance.
- **Senior Management**:  
    Senior management is responsible for reviewing and approving the PIA report, ensuring that any identified risks are adequately addressed, and providing resources for implementing mitigation strategies.

**5\. Enforcement**  
Failure to comply with this policy, including conducting required PIAs or implementing identified mitigation measures, may result in disciplinary actions or legal consequences. The organization may also be at risk of regulatory fines or penalties due to non-compliance with privacy regulations.

**6\. Review and Revision**  
This policy will be reviewed annually, or more frequently if there are significant changes to privacy regulations, systems, or organizational processes. Any updates or revisions will be communicated to all relevant stakeholders.
