**Physical Security Policy**

**1\. Purpose**  
The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines and procedures for protecting physical assets, including facilities, equipment, and personnel, from unauthorized access, theft, vandalism, natural disasters, and other physical threats. This policy aims to ensure that all physical security measures are in place to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational resources.

**2\. Scope**  
This policy applies to all physical assets of the organization, including:

- Facilities and buildings
- Equipment, servers, workstations, and other technology assets
- Personnel (employees, contractors, visitors)
- Physical access control systems (e.g., badges, keys, biometric systems)
- Any other physical resources that require protection from unauthorized access or harm

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, third-party vendors, and visitors who may interact with organizational physical assets.

**3\. Policy Statement**

**3.1 General Physical Security Requirements**

- The organization shall implement appropriate physical security measures to protect all critical assets, including facilities, technology, and personnel.
- Physical security measures shall include, but are not limited to, access controls, surveillance systems, alarm systems, physical barriers, and disaster preparedness measures.
- Physical access to sensitive areas shall be restricted to authorized personnel only, and access will be based on the principle of least privilege.
- All employees, contractors, and visitors shall adhere to the organization’s physical security procedures.

**3.2 Facility Security**

- **Perimeter Security**: The organization shall establish secure physical boundaries (e.g., fences, gates) to prevent unauthorized access to the facility.
- **Building Security**: All entry points to organizational buildings shall be secured with access control mechanisms, including locks, security doors, or biometric systems.
- **Visitor Control**: Visitors shall be required to sign in and be escorted by an authorized employee at all times when in secure areas of the facility. Visitor badges must be issued, and access shall be restricted to authorized areas only.
- **After-Hours Security**: Access to organizational facilities shall be restricted during non-business hours, with security personnel monitoring the premises, if applicable, or security systems (e.g., alarms, cameras) in place to detect unauthorized access.

**3.3 Access Control**

- **Identification and Authentication**: All personnel and visitors must have a valid form of identification to access organizational facilities. Employees and contractors shall be provided with access badges, key cards, or biometric access systems to control entry.
- **Access Restrictions**: Access to sensitive areas (e.g., data centers, server rooms, executive offices) shall be limited to authorized personnel with a legitimate need to access these areas.
- **Role-Based Access**: Access to specific areas shall be assigned based on job roles and responsibilities. Access control lists shall be maintained to ensure access is granted only to those who need it to perform their job functions.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: All access events (e.g., badge swipes, biometric authentication, manual entry) shall be logged and monitored for unusual or unauthorized access attempts. Security personnel shall review logs regularly for compliance with physical security policies.

**3.4 Equipment Security**

- **Asset Management**: All equipment, including servers, workstations, and storage devices, must be inventoried and tracked. The organization shall implement an asset management system to document the physical location, owner, and security status of all devices.
- **Secure Storage**: Sensitive equipment, including servers and backup media, shall be stored in locked rooms or cabinets with restricted access to authorized personnel.
- **Device Protection**: Portable devices (e.g., laptops, mobile devices) shall be physically secured when not in use, through the use of cable locks, secure storage areas, or similar methods. Employees must follow proper handling procedures to avoid loss or theft.

**3.5 Surveillance and Monitoring**

- **Video Surveillance**: Surveillance cameras shall be installed in critical areas, such as entrances, parking lots, server rooms, and other sensitive locations. The footage should be stored securely and monitored to detect suspicious activity.
- **Alarm Systems**: The organization shall deploy alarm systems to detect unauthorized access, intrusion, or fire hazards. Alarm systems should be integrated with security personnel or a third-party monitoring service.
- **Monitoring**: Security personnel (or third-party security providers) shall monitor security systems (e.g., alarms, surveillance cameras) 24/7 and respond promptly to incidents or alerts.

**3.6 Physical Barriers**

- **Access Restrictions**: Physical barriers such as security doors, gates, and fences shall be used to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive areas of the facility.
- **Safe Rooms**: Critical assets, such as server rooms or data centers, shall be housed in secure rooms with additional physical barriers (e.g., reinforced walls, doors) to prevent unauthorized access or tampering.
- **Lock and Key Management**: Keys to secure areas shall be issued only to authorized personnel, and records of all keys shall be maintained. Lost or stolen keys must be reported immediately to the security team, and rekeying may be required.

**3.7 Personnel Security**

- **Employee Training**: All employees, contractors, and third-party vendors shall be trained on physical security policies and procedures. This includes understanding access controls, reporting suspicious activities, and securing equipment and data.
- **Background Checks**: Personnel with access to sensitive areas or equipment shall undergo background checks to identify any potential security risks.
- **Termination Procedures**: When an employee or contractor’s employment is terminated, their access to physical facilities must be immediately revoked, including retrieval of access badges, keys, and other access mechanisms.

**3.8 Emergency Procedures**

- **Emergency Evacuation**: The organization shall develop and implement emergency evacuation procedures, including clear exit routes, emergency exits, and safe assembly points for personnel.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Physical security measures shall be integrated with disaster recovery plans to protect against physical threats such as fires, floods, or other natural disasters.
- **Incident Response**: Physical security incidents (e.g., unauthorized access, theft, vandalism) shall be reported to the appropriate authorities and investigated according to the organization’s incident response procedures.

**3.9 Environmental Security**

- **Facility Maintenance**: Regular maintenance of security systems, including surveillance cameras, alarm systems, and locks, must be conducted to ensure proper functioning.
- **Environmental Controls**: The organization shall implement environmental controls (e.g., temperature, humidity monitoring, fire suppression systems) to protect physical assets from environmental hazards.
- **Disaster Preparedness**: The organization must have plans in place to respond to natural disasters (e.g., fire, flood, earthquake), including securing facilities and recovering critical assets.

**4\. Roles and Responsibilities**

**4.1 Security Team**

- Implement and enforce the Physical Security Policy.
- Manage access control systems and monitor security incidents.
- Conduct regular security audits of physical assets and facilities.
- Oversee the installation and maintenance of surveillance and alarm systems.

**4.2 Facility Managers**

- Ensure secure access to and control over physical spaces within the organization.
- Manage physical security personnel and coordinate emergency response procedures.
- Ensure the security of sensitive equipment and data stored within facilities.

**4.3 Employees and Contractors**
