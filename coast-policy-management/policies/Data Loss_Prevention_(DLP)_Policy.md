**Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Policy**

**1\. Purpose**  
The purpose of this Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Policy is to protect sensitive information and ensure its confidentiality, integrity, and availability by preventing unauthorized access, leakage, or loss of data. This policy outlines the organization’s approach to identifying, monitoring, and mitigating the risks associated with data loss.

**2\. Scope**  
This policy applies to all data created, stored, or transmitted by the organization, including data in transit, at rest, and in use across all systems, devices, and networks. It covers employees, contractors, vendors, and any third parties with access to organizational data.

**3\. Policy Statement**

**3.1 Data Classification**

- **Sensitive Data Identification**:  
    All sensitive data must be identified and classified in accordance with the organization’s data classification policy. Sensitive data includes personally identifiable information (PII), financial records, intellectual property, protected health information (PHI), and other proprietary or confidential information.
- **Data Handling Requirements**:  
    Sensitive data must be handled according to established protocols for storage, access, transmission, and destruction. Access to sensitive data should be limited to individuals who need it to perform their job functions (principle of least privilege).

**3.2 Data Loss Prevention Technology**

- **DLP Tools Implementation**:  
    The organization will deploy Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools across endpoints, email systems, network traffic, and cloud environments. These tools should be configured to monitor and protect sensitive data by preventing unauthorized transmission, copying, or access.
- **Endpoint Protection**:  
    Endpoint DLP solutions will be used to monitor and control the movement of sensitive data across organizational devices (e.g., laptops, workstations, mobile devices). The DLP tools should block or restrict the transfer of sensitive data to unauthorized devices or external storage.
- **Email and Web Filtering**:  
    Email DLP solutions should be implemented to monitor outgoing emails for unauthorized sharing of sensitive data. Web filtering technologies will be used to prevent unauthorized uploads, downloads, or transfers of sensitive data via websites.

**3.3 Monitoring and Detection**

- **Data Movement Monitoring**:  
    Continuous monitoring of data movements (e.g., via network traffic, file transfers, email, cloud access) will be conducted to detect suspicious or unauthorized activities. Logs and alerts should be generated for any anomalous behavior, such as attempts to transmit sensitive data to unauthorized recipients.
- **Real-Time Detection**:  
    DLP systems should be configured to detect real-time unauthorized actions involving sensitive data, such as copying files to external devices, emailing sensitive data to unapproved recipients, or uploading data to non-approved cloud services.

**3.4 Access Control**

- **Access Control to Sensitive Data**:  
    Access to sensitive data must be controlled and restricted based on job roles. User access should be managed using role-based access control (RBAC), and users should only be allowed access to data necessary for their roles. The DLP system will enforce these access control measures to ensure that unauthorized users cannot access or transmit sensitive data.
- **Data Encryption**:  
    Sensitive data should be encrypted both at rest and in transit to protect it from unauthorized access during transmission or while stored on organizational systems.

**3.5 Data Protection During Transmission**

- **Data in Transit**:  
    All sensitive data in transit, whether across the internet, internal networks, or to third parties, should be encrypted using secure protocols (e.g., TLS, IPsec) to prevent interception or tampering.
- **Secure File Transfers**:  
    Secure file transfer methods, such as SFTP or encrypted email, must be used to transmit sensitive data externally. Data should not be transmitted via unsecured methods such as unencrypted email or file-sharing services unless explicitly approved.

**3.6 Data Disposal and Destruction**

- **Data Retention and Deletion**:  
    Sensitive data should be retained only for as long as necessary to fulfill business requirements and legal obligations. Once data is no longer needed, it must be securely destroyed to ensure that it cannot be recovered or accessed.
- **Data Sanitization**:  
    Data on storage media, including hard drives, USB drives, and backup tapes, should be sanitized using industry-standard data destruction methods before being decommissioned or disposed of.

**3.7 Incident Response and Reporting**

- **Data Loss Incidents**:  
    Any suspected or confirmed data loss incidents must be immediately reported to the organization's Incident Response Team (IRT). The IRT will investigate the cause, mitigate the risk, and take appropriate corrective actions.
- **Incident Documentation**:  
    All data loss incidents, whether real or suspected, must be documented and reviewed to understand the cause, impact, and steps taken to mitigate future occurrences. Lessons learned from each incident should be applied to strengthen DLP measures.

**3.8 Employee Training and Awareness**

- **Training Programs**:  
    All employees must undergo periodic training on data protection practices, including the handling of sensitive data, the use of DLP tools, and how to recognize potential data loss incidents. Employees should also be educated on the organization's policies for managing and reporting data loss.
- **Awareness Campaigns**:  
    Ongoing awareness campaigns will be conducted to keep data protection practices top of mind and to inform employees about new risks and technologies that may impact data security.

**3.9 Third-Party Access and Vendor Management**

- **Third-Party Risk Management**:  
    When third parties are given access to sensitive data, a thorough risk assessment must be conducted, and contracts must be established to define the security controls and DLP measures that must be in place. Third-party vendors must comply with the organization’s DLP policies and practices.

**3.10 Compliance and Auditing**

- **Compliance with Regulations**:  
    The organization will ensure that its DLP practices are compliant with relevant regulations, including GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and other applicable data protection laws. The DLP program should be periodically reviewed to ensure it remains in compliance with evolving regulations.
- **Audit and Review**:  
    Regular audits will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the DLP program. The audit will include reviewing DLP policies, system configurations, incidents, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Any gaps identified will be addressed to improve the DLP program.

**4\. Roles and Responsibilities**

- **DLP Program Manager**:  
    Responsible for overseeing the implementation and management of the organization’s DLP program, including ensuring the proper configuration and monitoring of DLP tools.
- **IT Security Team**:  
    Responsible for configuring and maintaining DLP tools, responding to data loss incidents, and providing technical expertise related to data protection.
- **Employees**:  
    Responsible for adhering to the DLP policy, attending training, and reporting any suspicious data loss activities or incidents.

**5\. Enforcement**  
Failure to comply with this policy can result in disciplinary action, including termination of employment, legal action, and other consequences, depending on the severity of the data loss incident and its impact on the organization.

**6\. Documentation and Recordkeeping**  
Records of data loss prevention measures, incidents, DLP configurations, and compliance audits should be retained in accordance with the organization’s retention policy.

**7\. Review and Revision**  
This policy will be reviewed at least annually or in response to significant changes in the organization’s data handling practices, legal requirements, or emerging threats. The policy will be updated as needed to address new risks or to improve existing controls.
