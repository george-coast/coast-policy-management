**Vulnerability Scanning Policy**

**1\. Purpose**  
The purpose of this Vulnerability Scanning Policy is to define the procedures for regularly scanning the organization’s systems, networks, and applications to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors. By detecting vulnerabilities early, the organization can mitigate security risks, improve system defenses, and ensure compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.

**2\. Scope**  
This policy applies to all organizational systems, devices, networks, applications, and cloud-based resources, including:

- Workstations and laptops
- Servers and databases
- Network infrastructure (routers, switches, firewalls, etc.)
- Cloud environments (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)
- Web and mobile applications
- External-facing services and endpoints

**3\. Policy Statement**

**3.1 Vulnerability Scanning Frequency**

- **Regular Scanning**:  
    Vulnerability scans will be performed on a scheduled basis to identify and assess vulnerabilities across the entire organization. Scans will be conducted at least **monthly** to ensure that vulnerabilities are identified and remediated promptly.
- **Critical Systems Scanning**:  
    Systems that are critical to the organization’s security posture, such as servers handling sensitive data, internet-facing systems, and systems with public-facing services, should be scanned **weekly** for vulnerabilities.
- **Ad-Hoc Scanning**:  
    Vulnerability scans will be initiated ad-hoc in response to significant security events, changes to critical systems, after major updates or changes, or when new vulnerabilities are disclosed.

**3.2 Vulnerability Scanning Tools and Techniques**

- **Automated Scanners**:  
    The organization will use automated vulnerability scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in software, hardware, and configurations. Tools used should be updated regularly to maintain the latest vulnerability definitions and scanning capabilities.
- **Scanners and Tools Selection**:  
    Scanning tools should include industry-standard software solutions, such as Nessus, Qualys, OpenVAS, or equivalent tools. The selected tools should support comprehensive vulnerability assessments, including but not limited to:
  - Operating system vulnerabilities
  - Application vulnerabilities
  - Network configuration issues
  - Misconfigurations
  - Exposed services or open ports
- **Credentialed vs. Non-Credentialed Scanning**:  
    Both credentialed (authenticated) and non-credentialed (unauthenticated) vulnerability scans will be performed. Credentialed scans provide deeper insight into potential vulnerabilities within a system by accessing system-level information.

**3.3 Vulnerability Identification and Classification**

- **Vulnerability Classification**:  
    Identified vulnerabilities will be classified based on their severity. Vulnerabilities will be categorized into the following severity levels:
  - **Critical**: Vulnerabilities that pose an immediate and significant risk to the organization, such as remote code execution (RCE), unauthenticated access, or privilege escalation.
  - **High**: Vulnerabilities that present a high risk, potentially allowing attackers to compromise systems or access sensitive data, but may require specific conditions to be exploited.
  - **Medium**: Vulnerabilities that may pose a moderate risk if combined with other threats or conditions.
  - **Low**: Vulnerabilities that pose minimal risk, but should still be addressed as part of ongoing risk management.
- **Risk Assessment**:  
    The security team will perform a risk assessment to prioritize vulnerabilities for remediation based on their classification and the potential impact on the organization's operations, assets, and security posture.

**3.4 Vulnerability Remediation**

- **Remediation Process**:  
    Once vulnerabilities are identified, they will be assigned for remediation according to their severity. Critical and high vulnerabilities must be addressed immediately, with fixes or mitigation strategies applied within **72 hours** for critical vulnerabilities and within **1 week** for high vulnerabilities.
- **Patch Management**:  
    Remediation efforts may involve applying patches, updating configurations, or removing vulnerable components. A coordinated approach with the Patch Management Policy will be followed to ensure timely application of patches.
- **Mitigation**:  
    In cases where vulnerabilities cannot be fixed immediately, temporary mitigation strategies (e.g., firewall rules, network segmentation, access controls) will be implemented to reduce risk.
- **Exception Handling**:  
    If a vulnerability cannot be remediated due to technical, business, or other constraints, an exception will be documented, and compensating controls will be implemented to manage the risk. Exceptions must be reviewed and approved by management.

**3.5 Reporting and Documentation**

- **Vulnerability Scan Reports**:  
    Vulnerability scan reports will be generated and reviewed by the IT/Security team. These reports will include detailed findings, identified vulnerabilities, their severity ratings, and remediation recommendations.
- **Management Reporting**:  
    Vulnerability scan results, including the status of remediation efforts, will be provided to senior management on a monthly or quarterly basis to ensure oversight and ensure that risks are appropriately managed.
- **Compliance and Auditing**:  
    Vulnerability scan results and remediation actions will be documented and retained in accordance with the organization’s record retention and auditing requirements.

**3.6 Vulnerability Scanning for Third-Party Services**

- **Third-Party Assessment**:  
    Third-party vendors or service providers that host systems, applications, or networks on behalf of the organization must provide vulnerability scanning reports or allow the organization to perform scans on these systems to ensure that they meet the organization’s security standards.
- **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)**:  
    The organization will establish SLAs with third-party providers to ensure that regular vulnerability scans are conducted on third-party systems and that vulnerabilities are remediated promptly.

**3.7 Vulnerability Scanning for Cloud Environments**

- **Cloud Asset Scanning**:  
    Cloud-based systems and infrastructure must undergo regular vulnerability scans in the same manner as on-premises systems. The security team will utilize appropriate scanning tools and configurations to ensure that vulnerabilities within cloud-based environments are identified and addressed.
- **Shared Responsibility Model**:  
    The organization will adhere to the shared responsibility model for cloud security. While the cloud provider is responsible for securing the cloud infrastructure, the organization is responsible for securing the applications and data hosted within the cloud. Vulnerability scanning will be applied to both.

**3.8 Vulnerability Scanning Remediation Metrics**

- **Remediation Timeliness**:  
    The organization will track the time to remediate vulnerabilities based on their severity, ensuring that critical vulnerabilities are addressed as soon as possible and no longer than the defined timelines (72 hours for critical, 1 week for high).
- **Effectiveness of Remediation**:  
    Following remediation, systems will be rescanned to confirm that vulnerabilities have been resolved. Any recurring vulnerabilities will be escalated for further review.

**4\. Roles and Responsibilities**

- **IT/Security Team**:  
    The IT/Security team is responsible for conducting vulnerability scans, reviewing scan results, prioritizing vulnerabilities, and coordinating remediation efforts.
- **System Owners**:  
    System owners are responsible for ensuring that vulnerabilities within their systems are remediated on time and in accordance with this policy.
- **Compliance/Management**:  
    Senior management will be responsible for overseeing the vulnerability management process and ensuring that adequate resources are allocated to the effort.

**5\. Enforcement**  
Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action and could lead to security incidents or non-compliance with applicable regulatory standards.

**6\. Review and Revision**  
This policy will be reviewed annually or upon significant changes to the organization’s systems, applications, or security posture, whichever occurs first.
