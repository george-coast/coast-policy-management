**Security Planning Policy**

**1\. Purpose**  
The purpose of this Security Planning Policy is to establish a framework for developing, managing, and maintaining security plans for all information systems within the organization. This policy ensures that security considerations are integrated into all phases of the system lifecycle, from initial design through ongoing operation, and that security risks are identified and mitigated in accordance with organizational and regulatory requirements, including NIST 800-53.

**2\. Scope**  
This policy applies to all information systems, applications, and services used by the organization, whether developed in-house or acquired. It covers systems and data managed by the organization’s IT department, contractors, and third-party service providers. The policy applies to all personnel involved in planning, designing, implementing, and managing the security of these systems.

**3\. Policy Statement**

**3.1 Security Planning Process**  
The organization shall develop and maintain a security plan for each information system, including but not limited to:

- **System Security Plans (SSP)**: Each information system shall have an SSP that outlines the security requirements, controls, and procedures in place to ensure that the system is protected throughout its lifecycle.
- **Continuous Review and Updates**: The security plan shall be reviewed and updated regularly to address emerging threats, new technologies, changes in regulations, and modifications to the system. Security planning should be an ongoing process, not limited to the initial system deployment.

The security planning process will include the following steps:

- **Define Security Objectives**: Clearly define the security objectives for the system, ensuring they align with organizational goals and legal or regulatory requirements.
- **Risk Assessment**: Perform a risk assessment to identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities that could impact the system.
- **Select Security Controls**: Identify and implement security controls based on risk assessments, compliance requirements, and system functionality.
- **Monitor and Assess Effectiveness**: Continuously monitor the effectiveness of the security controls and make adjustments as needed to address new threats or weaknesses.
- **Security Documentation**: Maintain complete and accurate documentation related to the security plan, including system configurations, roles and responsibilities, and incident response procedures.

**3.2 Security Control Selection**  
Security controls selected for inclusion in security plans must be based on a comprehensive analysis of risk, the specific needs of the system, and applicable standards. The organization shall ensure that security controls are derived from the following sources:

- **NIST 800-53**: Security and privacy controls for federal information systems and organizations.
- **NIST 800-171**: Security requirements for protecting Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).
- **ISO/IEC 27001**: International standard for information security management.
- **Legal and Regulatory Requirements**: Compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and contractual obligations.

Controls should include, but not be limited to, the following:

- **Access Control**: Mechanisms to ensure that access to systems and data is restricted based on roles and responsibilities.
- **Incident Response**: Procedures and protocols for detecting, reporting, and responding to security incidents.
- **Contingency Planning**: Strategies for ensuring system availability and recovery in the event of a disruption or breach.
- **Configuration Management**: Processes to ensure that systems are securely configured and maintained throughout their lifecycle.

**3.3 Risk Management**  
Security planning must be driven by a risk management approach. The organization shall:

- **Conduct Risk Assessments**: Periodically assess the risks associated with each system, considering the impact of threats and vulnerabilities, and prioritize security efforts based on the results.
- **Mitigate Identified Risks**: Implement measures to reduce identified risks to an acceptable level. This includes applying appropriate security controls, developing contingency plans, and monitoring for new risks.
- **Review and Update Risk Assessments**: Regularly update risk assessments and security plans to ensure they remain accurate and reflect any changes in the organization's environment, technology, or threats.

**3.4 Security Plan Documentation**  
The organization shall document the following components in its security plans:

- **System Description**: A description of the information system, including its components, architecture, and data flow.
- **Security Requirements**: Specific security requirements and controls that address confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Security Controls**: A list of implemented security controls, their status, and any deficiencies or gaps.
- **Responsibilities and Roles**: Identification of personnel responsible for security planning, implementation, and monitoring.
- **Risk Assessment**: A summary of the risk assessment, including identified risks and mitigation strategies.
- **Monitoring and Testing**: Procedures for monitoring the effectiveness of security controls, including regular testing and evaluation.

**3.5 Ongoing Monitoring and Maintenance**  
Once a security plan is developed and implemented, ongoing monitoring and maintenance are required to ensure that security controls remain effective over time. This includes:

- **Continuous Monitoring**: Implementing tools and processes to continuously monitor security events and identify potential vulnerabilities.
- **Security Audits and Reviews**: Conducting periodic audits to ensure compliance with the security plan and identifying areas for improvement.
- **Security Patching and Updates**: Regularly updating systems and applying patches to fix vulnerabilities and improve security.
- **Incident Reporting and Response**: Ensuring that any security incidents are reported, documented, and addressed in a timely manner.

**4\. Roles and Responsibilities**

- **Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)**: Overall responsibility for ensuring that security plans are developed, maintained, and updated in compliance with organizational policies and regulations.
- **System Owners**: Responsible for ensuring that security plans are developed for the systems they manage and that security controls are implemented and maintained.
- **IT Security Team**: Responsible for supporting the development and implementation of security plans, performing risk assessments, and ensuring continuous monitoring of security controls.
- **Risk Management Team**: Conducts risk assessments, reviews security plans, and recommends appropriate risk mitigation strategies.
- **Compliance Officer**: Ensures that security plans meet all relevant legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements.

**5\. Enforcement**  
Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary actions, including but not limited to the suspension of system development or implementation, revocation of access to systems, and potential legal or contractual consequences.

**6\. Review and Revision**  
This policy shall be reviewed annually or when significant changes occur in the organization’s security posture, technology, or regulatory requirements. The review process will involve key stakeholders, including security, IT, compliance, and risk management teams.
