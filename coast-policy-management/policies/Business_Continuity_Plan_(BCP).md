**Business Continuity Plan (BCP)**

**1\. Purpose**  
The purpose of this Business Continuity Plan (BCP) is to ensure the continuity of critical business operations and services during and after a disruption caused by natural disasters, cyberattacks, system failures, or other emergencies.

**2\. Scope**  
This plan applies to all organizational functions, personnel, assets, and third-party services critical to business operations. It covers preparation, response, and recovery strategies to maintain operational integrity.

**3\. Objectives**

- Minimize downtime and service disruptions.
- Protect critical business functions and resources.
- Provide a framework for recovering essential operations within predefined Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs).
- Ensure compliance with regulatory and legal requirements.

**4\. Key Components of the BCP**

**4.1 Business Impact Analysis (BIA)**

- Identify critical business functions and their dependencies.
- Determine the potential impact of various disruption scenarios on business operations.
- Establish RTOs and RPOs for each critical function.

**4.2 Risk Assessment**

- Identify risks and vulnerabilities to critical operations, including:
  - Cyber threats.
  - Natural disasters.
  - System failures.
  - Supply chain disruptions.
- Develop mitigation strategies for identified risks.

**4.3 Emergency Response Procedures**

- Define immediate actions to take during an emergency, including:
  - Evacuation plans.
  - Emergency communication protocols.
  - Incident response escalation procedures.

**4.4 Recovery Strategies**

- Develop specific recovery plans for critical functions, including:
  - IT systems and data recovery (integrated with the Disaster Recovery Plan).
  - Alternate worksite arrangements.
  - Manual workarounds for critical processes.

**4.5 Communication Plan**

- Establish a communication framework for notifying employees, stakeholders, and customers during a disruption.
- Maintain a contact directory of key personnel, vendors, and emergency services.
- Ensure communication systems are redundant and resilient.

**4.6 Plan Testing and Maintenance**

- Conduct annual BCP testing, including:
  - Tabletop exercises.
  - Simulated disruptions.
  - Full-scale operational tests.
- Update the BCP based on test results, organizational changes, and emerging risks.

**5\. Roles and Responsibilities**

**5.1 Business Continuity Manager**

- Oversee the development, implementation, and maintenance of the BCP.
- Coordinate response and recovery efforts during disruptions.

**5.2 IT Team**

- Implement and manage disaster recovery efforts for IT systems and data.
- Ensure backup systems and recovery processes align with BCP requirements.

**5.3 Department Heads**

- Identify critical functions within their departments.
- Ensure staff are trained on their roles during a disruption.

**5.4 Employees**

- Familiarize themselves with emergency procedures.
- Participate in training and exercises.
- Follow instructions during a disruption.

**6\. Plan Activation**  
The BCP will be activated in the event of a significant disruption. Activation criteria include:

- Downtime exceeding predefined thresholds for critical systems.
- Major incidents impacting personnel safety or operational continuity.
- Declaration of an emergency by senior management or the Business Continuity Manager.

**7\. Metrics and Reporting**

- Measure recovery times against RTOs and RPOs.
- Track the frequency and outcomes of BCP tests.
- Report key metrics to senior management.

**8\. Enforcement**  
Failure to comply with the BCP may result in disciplinary action. Third-party vendors must adhere to continuity requirements as defined in service agreements.

**9\. Review and Revision**  
The BCP will be reviewed annually or after major organizational, technological, or regulatory changes.
