**Maintenance Policy**

**1\. Purpose**  
The purpose of this policy is to establish the guidelines and procedures for the maintenance of organizational systems and infrastructure, ensuring their continuous performance, security, and compliance with relevant regulatory and security requirements.

**2\. Scope**  
This policy applies to all hardware, software, network infrastructure, and systems maintained by the organization, including third-party services that provide critical support or function as part of the organizational technology stack.

**3\. Policy Statement**

**3.1 Routine Maintenance**

- All systems and applications must undergo routine maintenance to ensure their optimal performance and security.
- Maintenance activities must be scheduled regularly and documented to avoid system disruptions and minimize downtime.
- Routine maintenance includes but is not limited to:
  - Software updates and patches (operating systems, applications, security tools).
  - Hardware health checks and replacements (e.g., hard drive, memory, etc.).
  - Performance monitoring and optimization.
  - Backup and data integrity verification.

**3.2 Emergency Maintenance**

- Emergency maintenance is performed when there is a critical system failure, security vulnerability, or other urgent issues affecting system functionality or security.
- Emergency maintenance must be executed promptly, with minimal disruption to services.
- All emergency maintenance activities must be logged, and the impact on systems and users must be documented.

**3.3 Maintenance Procedures**

- Maintenance procedures must include:
  - Identifying system components to be maintained or upgraded.
  - Verifying system configurations and ensuring changes are properly documented.
  - Conducting backups prior to any maintenance activity that may affect data integrity.
  - Applying patches and updates as per the organization’s patch management procedures.
  - Testing systems after maintenance to verify they meet performance and security expectations.
  - Communicating planned and emergency maintenance schedules to all relevant stakeholders.

**3.4 Security Updates and Patch Management**

- All systems and software must be updated with the latest security patches as soon as they become available.
- Critical security updates must be applied within 72 hours of release, with non-critical updates applied within 30 days.
- A documented patch management process must be maintained, and all updates must be verified post-deployment to ensure that systems remain secure and functional.

**3.5 Backup and Recovery Testing**

- Regular maintenance of backup systems and disaster recovery plans must be performed.
- Backup systems must be tested periodically to verify the integrity and reliability of data recovery procedures.
- Backup tests must occur at least quarterly or after significant infrastructure or software changes.

**3.6 Monitoring and Auditing**

- Systems must be continuously monitored to detect any issues, vulnerabilities, or performance degradation.
- Logs of all maintenance activities, including updates, patches, and configurations, must be maintained for auditing and compliance purposes.
- Regular audits of system configurations and maintenance activities must be conducted to ensure compliance with security standards and best practices.

**3.7 Vendor and Third-Party Maintenance**

- Third-party vendors or service providers responsible for maintaining critical systems or software must follow the organization’s maintenance policies and procedures.
- The organization must ensure that vendors’ maintenance activities comply with the relevant security and operational standards.
- Regular performance reviews and security assessments of third-party services must be conducted.

**3.8 Change Management**

- All maintenance activities, particularly those that involve changes to system configurations, must follow the organization’s change management policy.
- A change request must be submitted and reviewed prior to performing any maintenance that impacts the system’s functionality, security, or compliance status.

**4\. Roles and Responsibilities**

**4.1 IT Security Team**

- Develop and enforce maintenance schedules, procedures, and security standards for all systems.
- Ensure that security patches and updates are applied promptly and appropriately.
- Monitor and audit the effectiveness of maintenance activities.

**4.2 System Administrators**

- Execute routine maintenance tasks and implement corrective actions as necessary.
- Coordinate maintenance efforts across systems and infrastructure.
- Maintain documentation related to maintenance activities.

**4.3 Users**

- Report system issues or failures promptly to the IT support team for corrective action.
- Follow any instructions provided by IT teams during scheduled or emergency maintenance.

**5\. Training and Awareness**

- IT staff and system administrators must receive training on maintenance best practices, security patch management, and troubleshooting procedures.
- Users must be informed of scheduled maintenance windows and any anticipated downtime or system impact.

**6\. Enforcement**  
Failure to adhere to this policy may result in disciplinary action, including but not limited to restricted access to systems, reassignment of duties, or termination.

**7\. Review and Revision**  
This policy will be reviewed annually, or whenever there are significant changes in technology, regulations, or system requirements. Any revisions to this policy will be communicated to all relevant stakeholders.
