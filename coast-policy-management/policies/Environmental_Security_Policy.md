**Environmental Security Policy**

**1\. Purpose**  
The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines and procedures for ensuring the physical security of the organization’s infrastructure, including the protection of physical assets, sensitive data, and personnel. This policy aims to mitigate environmental threats, such as natural disasters, physical threats, and facility-related hazards, ensuring a secure and resilient operational environment.

**2\. Scope**  
This policy applies to all organizational facilities, infrastructure, and assets, including:

- Physical buildings, offices, and data centers
- Server rooms and equipment storage areas
- Environmental systems, such as HVAC and power systems
- Areas housing sensitive or critical assets, such as IT equipment, communication systems, and data storage devices

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third parties who interact with the organization’s physical facilities and infrastructure.

**3\. Policy Statement**

**3.1 Environmental Threat Mitigation**

- **Natural Disasters**: The organization shall identify and assess environmental risks, including natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, fires, and severe weather, and implement measures to mitigate their impact. This includes structural fortification, disaster recovery plans, and proper insurance coverage.
- **Power Failures and Surge Protection**: The organization shall implement backup power systems (e.g., generators and uninterruptible power supplies \[UPS\]) to ensure that critical systems remain operational during power outages. Electrical systems shall be properly grounded, and surge protectors shall be installed to safeguard equipment from electrical damage.
- **Fire Prevention and Safety**: Fire prevention systems, including fire alarms, sprinkler systems, and fire extinguishers, shall be in place. Regular fire drills shall be conducted, and fire safety procedures shall be well-documented and communicated.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and air quality in critical areas (e.g., server rooms and data centers) shall be continuously monitored to ensure optimal conditions and prevent equipment damage. Sensors shall alert personnel of abnormal conditions.

**3.2 Facility Access and Physical Security**

- **Controlled Access to Sensitive Areas**: Access to sensitive areas, such as server rooms, data storage facilities, and communication hubs, shall be restricted and controlled through physical security measures, including access cards, biometric authentication, and security guards.
- **Security Perimeter**: The organization shall implement security measures to protect the perimeter of facilities, including fencing, gates, cameras, and surveillance systems. The facility’s external security should be capable of preventing unauthorized access or attempts to breach the facility.
- **Emergency Exit Procedures**: Emergency exits, escape routes, and emergency alarms must be clearly marked, unobstructed, and accessible to ensure safe evacuation in the event of an emergency. These exit routes must be regularly tested for functionality.

**3.3 Critical Systems Protection**

- **Redundant Infrastructure**: Critical infrastructure systems such as HVAC, network connectivity, power supply, and fire suppression systems must be redundant to prevent single points of failure.
- **Server and Equipment Security**: All servers, networking equipment, and other critical systems must be securely housed in facilities designed to prevent unauthorized physical access. This includes locking server cabinets and limiting access to authorized personnel only.
- **Data Storage Protection**: Sensitive data, whether digital or physical, must be stored in secure, access-controlled locations. These storage locations must be protected from environmental hazards such as fire, water damage, and theft.

**3.4 Environmental Safety for Personnel**

- **Workplace Safety**: The organization shall maintain a safe and healthy work environment for all personnel, ensuring that facilities comply with occupational safety regulations and industry standards.
- **Emergency Response and Evacuation**: The organization shall develop and communicate emergency response plans for personnel in the event of environmental incidents, including natural disasters, fires, or security breaches. Regular evacuation drills and training must be conducted.
- **Employee Health and Safety**: The organization shall provide a safe and comfortable working environment, ensuring that HVAC systems are properly maintained to ensure clean air and proper temperature regulation. Safety measures, such as proper lighting and ergonomic setups, must be implemented.

**3.5 Environmental Incident Management**

- **Incident Response**: In the event of an environmental security incident, such as a fire, flood, or power failure, the organization shall follow established incident response procedures. These procedures shall include immediate containment, incident documentation, and communication with relevant stakeholders.
- **Investigation and Reporting**: Environmental security incidents must be promptly investigated to determine the cause and impact. A report must be prepared and shared with management, detailing lessons learned and corrective actions.
- **Environmental Risk Assessments**: The organization shall conduct periodic environmental risk assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities and threats. These assessments will guide the improvement of physical security measures, disaster recovery plans, and other safeguards.

**3.6 Compliance with Legal and Regulatory Requirements**  
The organization shall ensure that its environmental security measures comply with all relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards related to physical security, occupational safety, and environmental protection.

**3.7 Training and Awareness**

- **Employee Training**: Employees must be trained on environmental security protocols, including emergency procedures, the importance of safeguarding critical infrastructure, and how to recognize and report potential environmental hazards.
- **Ongoing Awareness Programs**: The organization shall conduct regular awareness programs to ensure that all employees remain informed about new environmental security threats, mitigation strategies, and changes to policies or procedures.

**4\. Roles and Responsibilities**

**4.1 Facility Manager**

- Oversee the implementation and maintenance of environmental security measures within organizational facilities.
- Ensure that disaster recovery, fire prevention, and security measures are in place and regularly tested.
- Conduct environmental risk assessments and recommend improvements based on findings.

**4.2 Security Officer**

- Manage the physical security of the facility, including controlling access to sensitive areas.
- Monitor environmental conditions, such as temperature and humidity in critical areas, to ensure the protection of sensitive equipment.
- Respond to environmental security incidents and initiate corrective actions as necessary.

**4.3 IT Department**

- Work with facility management to ensure the security of critical infrastructure, including servers and data storage devices.
- Implement redundant power and network systems to minimize downtime in case of environmental failure.
- Regularly back up critical systems and data to ensure recovery in the event of an environmental incident.

**4.4 Employees and Contractors**

- Follow all facility security procedures, including reporting environmental hazards and security concerns.
- Participate in environmental safety training and emergency drills.
- Ensure that their actions do not put organizational assets, personnel, or the facility at risk.

**5\. Enforcement**  
Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary actions, including suspension of facility access, termination of employment, or contract termination. Employees and contractors who violate environmental security procedures may be held accountable for any damages or disruptions caused.

**6\. Review and Revision**  
This policy shall be reviewed and updated annually or as significant environmental or facility-related changes occur. Any revisions to this policy must be communicated to all relevant stakeholders.
