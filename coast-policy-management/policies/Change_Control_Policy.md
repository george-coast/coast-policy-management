**Change Control Policy**

**1\. Purpose**  
The purpose of this policy is to establish a structured approach for managing changes to systems, applications, networks, and configurations. The goal is to minimize risks, ensure security, and maintain operational integrity.

**2\. Scope**  
This policy applies to all changes to information systems, applications, networks, and configurations owned, managed, or operated by the organization. It includes internal and third-party systems that interact with organizational resources.

**3\. Policy Statement**

**3.1 Change Management Objectives**

- Ensure that all changes are documented, tested, approved, and implemented securely.
- Minimize disruptions caused by changes to critical systems.
- Identify and mitigate risks associated with proposed changes.

**3.2 Types of Changes Covered**  
This policy applies to the following types of changes:

- Hardware and software installations or upgrades.
- Configuration modifications.
- Application updates or patches.
- Network or infrastructure changes.
- Emergency changes to address critical vulnerabilities or incidents.

**3.3 Change Control Process**  
All changes must follow the steps below:

1. **Request Submission**:
    - Changes must be initiated with a formal change request, including the following details:
        - Description of the change.
        - Reason for the change.
        - Impact analysis (including potential risks).
        - Rollback plan.
2. **Review and Approval**:
    - The Change Control Board (CCB) or designated approvers must review all change requests to:
        - Validate alignment with business objectives.
        - Assess risks and impacts on security, compliance, and operations.
        - Approve, deny, or request modifications to the proposed change.
3. **Testing**:
    - All changes must be tested in a non-production environment to evaluate potential impacts and ensure compatibility.
4. **Scheduling**:
    - Approved changes must be scheduled to minimize disruptions to business operations.
5. **Implementation**:
    - Changes must be implemented by authorized personnel according to the approved plan.
    - Emergency changes must follow expedited implementation but require post-change review.
6. **Post-Implementation Review**:
    - Review implemented changes to ensure they were successful and did not introduce unexpected issues.

**3.4 Emergency Changes**

- Emergency changes may bypass standard approval processes but must be documented and reviewed retrospectively by the CCB.

**3.5 Change Documentation and Logging**

- Maintain a log of all changes, including:
  - Change request details.
  - Approval records.
  - Testing results.
  - Implementation actions and dates.

**3.6 Monitoring and Auditing**

- Periodically review and audit changes to ensure adherence to the policy and detect unauthorized modifications.

**4\. Roles and Responsibilities**

**4.1 Change Control Board (CCB)**

- Review, approve, and prioritize change requests.
- Monitor the effectiveness of the change management process.

**4.2 IT and Security Teams**

- Assist in evaluating the security and operational impact of changes.
- Implement and test approved changes.
- Monitor systems for unauthorized or unapproved changes.

**4.3 System Owners**

- Submit change requests for their respective systems.
- Ensure changes align with business and security requirements.

**4.4 Employees and Contractors**

- Adhere to the change control process.
- Report unauthorized or unapproved changes to the IT team.

**5\. Enforcement**  
Non-compliance with this policy may result in disciplinary action, including revocation of system access or termination of employment. Systems with unauthorized changes may be reverted or decommissioned.

**6\. Review and Revision**  
This policy must be reviewed annually or whenever significant changes occur to the organizationâ€™s systems, processes, or regulatory requirements.
