**Network Security Policy**

**1\. Purpose**  
The purpose of this Network Security Policy is to establish guidelines and controls for ensuring the security of the organization’s network infrastructure. This policy aims to safeguard sensitive data, prevent unauthorized access, and mitigate risks associated with network vulnerabilities and cyber threats.

**2\. Scope**  
This policy applies to all network devices, systems, and applications within the organization’s network infrastructure. It covers all physical and virtual network components, including routers, switches, firewalls, access points, and other network services. The policy also applies to third-party vendors and contractors with access to the organization’s network.

**3\. Policy Statement**

**3.1 Network Segmentation and Access Control**

- **Network Segmentation**:  
    The organization must implement network segmentation to isolate sensitive systems, such as financial, healthcare, and personally identifiable information (PII) systems, from less sensitive systems. Network segments should be isolated using firewalls, VLANs, or other segmentation technologies.
- **Access Control**:  
    Access to network segments, systems, and devices must be restricted based on the principle of least privilege. Only authorized personnel should have access to sensitive network resources. Access control lists (ACLs), firewalls, and network access control (NAC) solutions should be used to enforce access control policies.

**3.2 Firewalls and Perimeter Security**

- **Firewalls**:  
    Firewalls must be deployed at all network entry and exit points to protect the organization from external threats. The firewalls must be configured to block unauthorized inbound and outbound traffic while allowing legitimate communication necessary for business operations.
- **Perimeter Security**:  
    Network perimeter security devices (e.g., intrusion prevention systems (IPS), intrusion detection systems (IDS), and web application firewalls (WAF)) must be used to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic to detect and mitigate threats such as malware, unauthorized access, and data exfiltration.

**3.3 Virtual Private Network (VPN) and Remote Access**

- **VPN Usage**:  
    The organization must require the use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) for all remote access to internal systems and data. VPN connections must be encrypted using industry-standard protocols (e.g., IPsec, SSL/TLS) to ensure confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted over the network.
- **Remote Access Control**:  
    Remote access to the network must be authenticated using multi-factor authentication (MFA) and be authorized based on role-based access controls (RBAC). All remote access connections must be logged and monitored for suspicious activity.

**3.4 Intrusion Detection and Prevention**

- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**:  
    IDS solutions should be deployed on critical network segments to detect potential security breaches, abnormal traffic patterns, or unauthorized access attempts. IDS solutions must be regularly updated with the latest attack signatures.
- **Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)**:  
    IPS solutions must be implemented to actively prevent detected intrusions and mitigate network attacks. IPS solutions should be configured to automatically block or alert on suspicious activities, such as DoS attacks or unauthorized access attempts.

**3.5 Network Monitoring and Logging**

- **Continuous Monitoring**:  
    The organization must implement continuous network monitoring to detect, analyze, and respond to network threats in real-time. Network activity should be logged and regularly reviewed to identify potential security incidents.
- **Logging**:  
    Logs from network devices (e.g., routers, switches, firewalls, IDS/IPS) must be collected and stored securely for a minimum retention period, as defined by the organization’s data retention policy. Logs must be regularly reviewed for anomalies and suspicious activities.

**3.6 Wireless Network Security**

- **Wi-Fi Security**:  
    All wireless networks must be secured using strong encryption (e.g., WPA3) and require authentication for access. Wireless networks should be isolated from internal networks using proper segmentation, and unauthorized Wi-Fi access points must be prevented using wireless intrusion detection systems (WIDS).
- **Guest Networks**:  
    Guest networks must be separate from the internal network and restricted to internet-only access. Any access to the internal network via guest networks must be prohibited.

**3.7 Network Device Configuration and Management**

- **Secure Configuration**:  
    All network devices (e.g., routers, switches, firewalls) must be securely configured following industry best practices and guidelines. Default passwords, open ports, and unnecessary services should be disabled to minimize vulnerabilities.
- **Regular Updates and Patch Management**:  
    Network devices must be regularly updated with security patches to address known vulnerabilities. A patch management process should be placed to ensure that security patches are tested and applied in a timely manner.

**3.8 Security Testing and Vulnerability Management**

- **Network Penetration Testing**:  
    Regular penetration testing should be conducted on the organization’s network to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. Penetration testing results should be used to strengthen network security controls.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**:  
    Vulnerability scanning tools must be used regularly to detect security flaws in network devices and systems. Identified vulnerabilities should be addressed through patching or remediation efforts.

**3.9 Third-Party Access**

- **Third-Party Network Access**:  
    All third-party vendors and contractors who require access to the organization's network must comply with this network security policy. Access must be limited to the specific resources needed, and third-party access must be monitored and logged.

**3.10 Network Data Protection**

- **Data in Transit**:  
    All sensitive data transmitted over the network must be encrypted using secure protocols (e.g., TLS, IPsec) to protect it from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Network Traffic Analysis**:  
    Network traffic should be analyzed for sensitive data leakage and for patterns that may indicate security threats, such as data exfiltration or communication with malicious IP addresses.

**4\. Roles and Responsibilities**

- **Network Security Team**:  
    Responsible for the implementation, configuration, and maintenance of network security controls, including firewalls, IDS/IPS, VPNs, and network monitoring systems.
- **System Administrators**:  
    Responsible for configuring and securing network devices, applying patches, and maintaining network device security settings.
- **Employees**:  
    Responsible for adhering to the network security policies when accessing or using the organization’s network resources.

**5\. Enforcement**  
Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, including termination, depending on the severity of the breach. Non-compliance with network security protocols may lead to security incidents, data breaches, and legal liabilities.

**6\. Documentation and Recordkeeping**  
Records of network security configurations, changes, vulnerability assessments, and third-party access should be maintained in accordance with the organization’s document retention policy.

**7\. Review and Revision**  
This policy will be reviewed annually or in response to significant changes to the network infrastructure, security landscape, or regulatory requirements. Changes will be made to address emerging threats and ensure that network security practices remain effective.
