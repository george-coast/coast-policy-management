**Identification and Authentication Policy**

**1\. Purpose**  
The purpose of this policy is to establish controls for verifying the identity of users, systems, and devices before granting access to organizational resources. This ensures that access is limited to authorized individuals and systems, protecting sensitive data and critical infrastructure.

**2\. Scope**  
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, third-party vendors, and systems accessing organizational resources, including on-premises and cloud environments.

**3\. Policy Statement**

**3.1 Identification**

- All users, devices, and systems must have a unique identifier to enable accountability.
- Shared accounts are prohibited except for approved service accounts, which must be strictly controlled and monitored.
- Users must use their assigned credentials and are prohibited from sharing them with others.

**3.2 Authentication**

- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for access to:
  - Privileged accounts.
  - Sensitive systems, applications, and data.
  - Remote access to the network.
- Passwords must meet the following minimum requirements:
  - Length: At least 12 characters.
  - Complexity: Include a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
  - Expiry: Change every 90 days or as required by the system.
- System-to-system communication must use mutual authentication (e.g., certificates, API keys).

**3.3 Device Authentication**

- Devices accessing organizational systems must be authenticated using:
  - Digital certificates.
  - Secure tokens or device management solutions.

**3.4 Account Lockout**

- Accounts will be locked after 5 failed login attempts and will remain locked for a minimum of 15 minutes or until manually reset by an administrator.
- Lockout thresholds for privileged accounts may be stricter as required.

**3.5 Privileged Accounts**

- Privileged accounts must have distinct credentials from regular accounts.
- Use of privileged accounts must be logged and monitored in accordance with the **Audit Log Management Policy**.

**3.6 Third-Party Authentication**

- Third-party users and systems must comply with the organizationâ€™s authentication requirements.
- Remote vendor access must be enabled only during approved time windows and monitored closely.

**3.7 Emergency Access**

- Emergency access (break-glass accounts) must be documented, tightly controlled, and monitored.
- Credentials for emergency access must be stored securely, with access limited to authorized personnel.

**4\. Roles and Responsibilities**

**4.1 IT Security Team**

- Implement and enforce identification and authentication controls.
- Monitor compliance with authentication requirements.
- Respond to and investigate authentication-related incidents.

**4.2 Employees**

- Use only assigned credentials and never share them.
- Report lost or compromised credentials immediately.

**4.3 System Owners**

- Ensure systems under their control comply with this policy.
- Apply secure authentication mechanisms to their systems.

**5\. Training and Awareness**

- All personnel must receive training on secure authentication practices and the importance of protecting credentials.
- New employees must complete this training during onboarding.

**6\. Enforcement**

- Non-compliance with this policy may result in disciplinary actions, up to and including termination of employment or contract.

**7\. Metrics and Reporting**

- Report on failed login attempts, locked accounts, and incidents of unauthorized access quarterly.
- Review authentication logs to identify anomalies.

**8\. Review and Revision**  
This policy will be reviewed annually or after significant changes to the IT environment or regulatory requirements.
