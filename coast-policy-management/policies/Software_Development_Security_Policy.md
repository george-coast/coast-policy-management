**Software Development Security Policy**

**1\. Purpose**  
The purpose of this Software Development Security Policy is to define the requirements and guidelines for developing, maintaining, and securing software applications used within the organization. This policy ensures that software development practices incorporate security throughout the development life cycle, from design through implementation and deployment, to protect the organization’s systems and data.

**2\. Scope**  
This policy applies to all software development efforts within the organization, including internal applications, third-party software integrations, and custom software development projects. It applies to all developers, engineers, contractors, and teams involved in the software development process.

**3\. Policy Statement**

**3.1 Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**  
The organization will follow a Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) that integrates security practices into each phase of the software development process. This includes, but is not limited to:

- **Planning and Requirements**: Identifying and documenting security requirements and compliance considerations for software applications from the beginning of the project.
- **Design**: Conducting threat modeling and risk assessments during the design phase to identify potential security vulnerabilities and address them proactively.
- **Development**: Implementing secure coding practices to minimize vulnerabilities and incorporating code reviews and automated security testing.
- **Testing**: Performing security testing, including static code analysis, dynamic application security testing (DAST), and penetration testing, to identify and mitigate security flaws.
- **Deployment and Maintenance**: Implementing security measures for the deployment process and maintaining secure software through ongoing patching, vulnerability management, and regular security audits.

**3.2 Secure Coding Standards**  
All software developers must follow secure coding standards, such as those recommended by OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) or other recognized frameworks. These standards should include:

- Input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection).
- Proper error handling to avoid revealing sensitive system information.
- Secure data storage and transmission practices (e.g., encryption of sensitive data in transit and at rest).
- Proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect access to sensitive functions and data.
- Prevention of cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in web applications.

**3.3 Code Reviews and Testing**  
All code must undergo a peer review process to identify security vulnerabilities, logic errors, and potential issues. Automated static code analysis tools should be used to identify common vulnerabilities early in the development process.

- **Automated Security Testing**: Incorporate automated security testing tools to check for known vulnerabilities and ensure that the code adheres to secure coding practices.
- **Manual Code Reviews**: Code must be reviewed manually to ensure that security risks are identified and mitigated. Critical or high-risk applications should undergo more thorough review processes.
- **Penetration Testing**: Before deployment, a comprehensive penetration test should be conducted to assess the security posture of the application and to identify any exploitable vulnerabilities.

**3.4 Vulnerability Management**  
Any security vulnerabilities discovered in software, either during the development process or after deployment, must be addressed promptly through the organization’s vulnerability management process. This includes:

- **Patch Management**: Ensuring that any security vulnerabilities discovered during development or post-release are patched in a timely manner.
- **Incident Response**: Developing and following incident response procedures for when a security breach or vulnerability is detected in deployed software.

**3.5 Secure Development Environment**  
The organization will ensure that all development environments are secured, including access controls to prevent unauthorized access to source code and tools.

- **Source Code Management (SCM)**: Use version control systems (e.g., Git) for source code and ensure that proper access controls are implemented to restrict access to authorized developers.
- **Development Tools**: All tools used in the development process must be regularly updated and secured against potential exploits.
- **Access Control**: Access to the development environment must be restricted to authorized personnel, and user activities should be logged and monitored.

**3.6 Security Training and Awareness**  
Developers and software engineers must undergo regular security training to stay updated on the latest secure coding practices, emerging threats, and vulnerabilities. Training should include:

- **OWASP Top Ten**: A review of the most common security vulnerabilities in web applications, such as SQL injection, XSS, and insecure deserialization.
- **Secure Development Practices**: Best practices for secure coding and software design.
- **Threat Intelligence**: Awareness of current security threats, attack vectors, and mitigation strategies.

**3.7 Third-Party Software and Libraries**  
Third-party software, frameworks, and libraries that are incorporated into the software development process must be evaluated for security risks. This includes:

- **Security Assessment**: Assessing the security posture of third-party libraries and components before integration.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Continuously monitoring third-party libraries for security vulnerabilities and updates.
- **Licensing and Compliance**: Ensuring that third-party software complies with licensing agreements and regulatory requirements.

**3.8 Secure Deployment and Configuration**  
The deployment process must follow security best practices to protect against attacks that target deployment stages. This includes:

- **Secure Configuration**: Ensuring that the software is securely configured before being deployed into production environments.
- **Environment Segregation**: Ensuring that development, staging, and production environments are properly segregated to prevent the exposure of sensitive information.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Enabling security monitoring and logging of software applications to detect and respond to security events in real-time.

**3.9 Change Management**  
Changes to software, whether they are fixes, updates, or new features, must follow a formal change management process that includes:

- **Impact Assessment**: Evaluating the security implications of any changes made to the software.
- **Testing**: Ensuring that security tests are performed on any changes before they are deployed.
- **Approval**: Changes must be approved by relevant stakeholders, including security personnel, before being deployed.

**3.10 Incident Response**  
A formal incident response plan must be in place for software applications. This plan should address how to respond to security incidents, including breaches or vulnerabilities discovered after deployment. The plan should include:

- **Incident Detection**: Mechanisms for detecting security incidents in software applications.
- **Containment and Mitigation**: Procedures for containing and mitigating the effects of an incident.
- **Notification**: Clear procedures for notifying stakeholders, customers, and regulatory bodies if sensitive data is compromised.

**4\. Roles and Responsibilities**

- **Development Team**: Responsible for implementing secure coding practices, conducting code reviews, and following the Secure SDLC process.
- **Security Team**: Responsible for conducting security assessments, vulnerability testing, and providing guidance on security best practices throughout the SDLC.
- **Quality Assurance (QA) Team**: Responsible for performing security-focused testing, including penetration testing and static analysis, to identify vulnerabilities.
- **IT Operations**: Responsible for ensuring that secure deployment practices are followed and that security controls are in place during production use.

**5\. Enforcement**  
Failure to adhere to this policy may result in disciplinary action, including termination of employment for employees, and potential legal consequences for contractors and vendors. Security vulnerabilities discovered due to non-compliance may be subject to remediation and incident response procedures.

**6\. Documentation and Recordkeeping**  
All activities related to software development security must be documented and records must be kept in accordance with the organization’s record retention policies. These records should include:

- **Design and architecture documents** with security considerations.
- **Code reviews and security testing reports**.
- **Incident response logs** related to software vulnerabilities.

**7\. Review and Revision**  
This policy will be reviewed at least annually to ensure that it remains current with industry best practices and regulatory requirements. The review process will assess the effectiveness of the policy and recommend changes as needed.
