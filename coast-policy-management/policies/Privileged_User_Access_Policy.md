Privileged User Access Policy

1\. Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for the management, monitoring, and control of privileged user accounts to protect the organization’s systems, data, and resources. It ensures compliance with NIST 800-53 standards for safeguarding elevated access.

2\. Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third parties who are granted privileged access to the organization’s systems, networks, applications, and data. Privileged access includes administrative accounts, root accounts, system accounts, and any other accounts with elevated permissions.

3\. Policy Statement

3.1 Definition of Privileged Access

Privileged accounts are defined as accounts that provide administrative or elevated access to systems, applications, or data beyond that of a standard user. Examples include:

System administrators

Database administrators

Network engineers

Root accounts or equivalent

3.2 Account Creation and Authorization

Privileged accounts shall only be created upon documented approval by the system owner and the security team.

Users must sign an acknowledgment of responsibilities before being granted privileged access.

3.3 Principle of Least Privilege

Privileged access must be limited to the minimum necessary to perform job functions.

Privileged users shall not use elevated accounts for non-administrative activities (e.g., browsing the web, checking email).

3.4 Authentication Requirements

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is mandatory for all privileged accounts.

Passwords for privileged accounts must meet the organization’s password policy and be rotated every 60 days.

Privileged accounts must not share passwords or credentials under any circumstances.

3.5 Activity Monitoring and Logging

All activities performed with privileged accounts must be logged, including login attempts, commands executed, and configuration changes.

Logs must be retained for at least 12 months and reviewed regularly by the security team.

3.6 Session Management

Privileged sessions must be secured with encrypted protocols (e.g., SSH, HTTPS).

Sessions must automatically time out after 15 minutes of inactivity.

3.7 Training and Awareness

Privileged users must complete specialized training on security best practices, risks, and their responsibilities annually.

Users must acknowledge their understanding of the policy upon completion of training.

3.8 Account Reviews

Privileged access must be reviewed at least quarterly to ensure it aligns with current job responsibilities.

Accounts identified as unnecessary must be disabled immediately.

3.9 Incident Response

Any suspected misuse or compromise of a privileged account must be reported to the security team immediately.

Privileged accounts involved in a security incident must be disabled until the issue is resolved.

3.10 Third-Party Privileged Access

Vendors or contractors with privileged access must sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) and comply with this policy.

Third-party accounts must be time-limited and removed immediately after their purpose is fulfilled.

4\. Roles and Responsibilities

4.1 Privileged Users

Ensure that elevated access is used only for authorized purposes.

Report any suspicious activity or potential misuse of their accounts.

4.2 System Administrators

Review privileged account activity and ensure compliance.

4.3 Security Team

Monitor and audit privileged account activity regularly.

Investigate incidents and ensure timely remediation of issues.

4.4 Managers and Supervisors

This policy will be reviewed annually or as needed following changes in technology, organizational structure, or regulatory requirements.
