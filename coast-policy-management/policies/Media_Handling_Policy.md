**Media Handling Policy**

**1\. Purpose**  
The purpose of this policy is to ensure the secure handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of all physical media containing sensitive data. This policy aims to protect organizational data from unauthorized access, disclosure, or destruction throughout the media lifecycle, from acquisition to disposal.

**2\. Scope**  
This policy applies to all physical media used to store organizational data, including but not limited to:

- Hard drives, solid-state drives, and magnetic tapes
- Optical media (e.g., CDs, DVDs)
- USB flash drives, external storage devices
- Paper documents, printed reports, and backup media
- Mobile devices and other portable storage media
- Cloud storage solutions used to handle physical media backups

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who handle such media.

**3\. Policy Statement**

**3.1 Media Classification**

- All media containing sensitive or confidential information must be classified based on its content, in line with the organization’s data classification policy.
- Media containing sensitive data must be handled with higher security and protection measures than non-sensitive media.
- Media should be labeled clearly to indicate its classification (e.g., "Confidential," "Restricted," "Internal Use Only").

**3.2 Media Acquisition and Receipt**

- Media acquired for organizational use must be checked for tampering or damage before use.
- Any media received must be logged in a media inventory management system, including the type, quantity, and content classification.
- The acquisition of media must follow secure procurement procedures to ensure that it has not been compromised.

**3.3 Media Storage**

- Media containing sensitive data must be stored securely in locked cabinets, safes, or controlled access areas.
- Storage areas must be physically protected against unauthorized access, theft, fire, water damage, and environmental hazards.
- Media must be categorized by sensitivity and stored according to the organization’s classification requirements.
- Portable media must be protected with encryption if it contains sensitive data, both during storage and in transit.

**3.4 Media Transportation**

- Any physical media containing sensitive data that is transported between locations must be securely packaged and protected to prevent unauthorized access.
- The transfer of media must be logged and tracked, with details including the sender, receiver, type of media, and destination.
- Media containing sensitive data should only be transported through secure channels and handled by authorized personnel.

**3.5 Media Use**

- Authorized personnel must handle media containing sensitive data according to the organization’s security protocols.
- Access to sensitive media should be restricted to only those individuals with a valid need to know.
- The use of removable media (e.g., USB drives, external hard drives) should be minimized. When used, it must be encrypted, and data should not be transferred to unapproved systems.
- All systems accessing sensitive media must be protected with appropriate security measures, including antivirus software, firewalls, and encryption.

**3.6 Media Sanitization**

- Before disposal, repurposing, or reuse, all media containing sensitive data must undergo proper sanitization to ensure that the data cannot be recovered.
- Sanitization methods may include data wiping, degaussing, or physical destruction, depending on the media type.
- A certificate of sanitization or destruction must be retained for all media that has been securely wiped or destroyed.
- For devices that cannot be securely sanitized (e.g., damaged hard drives), the equipment must be physically destroyed to prevent data recovery.

**3.7 Media Disposal**

- All media that is no longer required for organizational use must be securely disposed of following the organization’s data destruction procedures.
- Sensitive media must be disposed of through authorized vendors who comply with the organization’s sanitization and disposal policies.
- A certificate of disposal must be obtained from third-party vendors for the destruction or disposal of sensitive media.

**3.8 Media Inventory Management**

- An inventory of all media containing sensitive data must be maintained, and any media transferred, stored, or disposed of must be logged.
- Media that is lost or compromised must be reported immediately to the appropriate authorities, and corrective actions must be taken to address the incident.
- Media inventory must be periodically audited to ensure that all sensitive data is properly protected and accounted for.

**3.9 Use of Cloud-Based Media**

- Cloud-based media solutions must be reviewed to ensure they provide adequate security and comply with the organization’s data protection standards.
- Cloud storage used for sensitive media must be encrypted, and access controls must be enforced to prevent unauthorized access.
- The same principles of physical media handling must be applied to cloud-based media in terms of access, classification, and sanitization.

**4\. Roles and Responsibilities**

**4.1 IT Security Team**

- Develop and enforce media handling policies and procedures.
- Ensure that sensitive media is stored, transported, and disposed of securely.
- Conduct audits of media inventory to ensure compliance with this policy.
- Oversee the implementation of encryption, sanitization, and disposal methods for media.

**4.2 Media Custodians**

- Ensure that media in their custody is handled in accordance with this policy.
- Maintain accurate records of all media containing sensitive data, including when it is moved, transferred, or disposed of.
- Ensure that media is securely stored and protected against unauthorized access or loss.

**4.3 Employees and Contractors**

- Follow the media handling procedures outlined in this policy when using or handling media containing sensitive information.
- Report any lost or compromised media immediately to the IT Security team.

**5\. Training and Awareness**

- Employees must be trained on the importance of securing sensitive media and the procedures for handling, storing, and disposing of it.
- IT staff and media custodians must receive training on the latest media security technologies and sanitization practices to ensure the proper protection of sensitive data.

**6\. Enforcement**  
Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, including but not limited to restricted access to organizational media, reassignment of duties, or termination.

**7\. Review and Revision**  
This policy will be reviewed annually or whenever there are significant changes in technology, regulations, or equipment. Updates to this policy will be communicated to all relevant stakeholders.
