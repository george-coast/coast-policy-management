**Patch Management Policy**

**1\. Purpose**  
The purpose of this Patch Management Policy is to ensure that all systems, applications, and devices within the organization are regularly updated with security patches and software updates. The policy aims to reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities and to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational assets.

**2\. Scope**  
This policy applies to all devices, systems, applications, and software used within the organization, including but not limited to:

- Workstations
- Laptops
- Servers
- Network devices
- Mobile devices
- Software applications (both proprietary and third-party)
- Cloud environments

**3\. Policy Statement**

**3.1 Patch Management Process**

- **Patch Identification**:  
    All systems, applications, and devices will be regularly monitored for available patches and updates. The IT/Security team will actively track vendor-provided security patches, software updates, and new security advisories.
- **Patch Prioritization**:  
    Patches will be prioritized based on their severity, impact on system functionality, and the sensitivity of the affected system. Critical patches, especially those addressing vulnerabilities classified as high or critical by the vendor or relevant security standards (e.g., CVSS scores), should be applied immediately.
- **Patch Testing**:  
    Before deployment, patches should be tested in a controlled environment to ensure compatibility with the organization’s systems, applications, and configurations. This testing phase helps prevent system failures and ensures that patches do not introduce new issues.
- **Patch Deployment**:  
    Once tested and verified, patches will be deployed to affected systems and devices. The deployment process should be automated where possible to ensure timely application and consistency. Systems should be patched during scheduled maintenance windows to minimize disruption to operations.
- **Patch Verification**:  
    After deployment, patches should be verified to ensure they were applied successfully. Automated tools will be used to confirm the installation of patches and that systems are running the most current versions of software.
- **Patch Rollback**:  
    In the event of an issue caused by a patch (e.g., system instability or functionality issues), a rollback procedure will be in place. Systems should be restored to their previous state using backups or system snapshots if necessary.

**3.2 Timeliness of Patches**

- **Critical Patches**:  
    Critical patches addressing vulnerabilities with known exploitability or those that directly affect sensitive data must be applied within **72 hours** of release.
- **High-Priority Patches**:  
    High-priority patches that address non-critical vulnerabilities but still pose significant risks to the organization should be applied within **1 week** of release.
- **Regular Patches**:  
    Non-critical patches or updates that do not pose immediate threats but improve system functionality or fix bugs should be applied within **30 days** of release.

**3.3 Patch Management Responsibilities**

- **IT/Security Team**:  
    The IT/Security team is responsible for monitoring, identifying, and tracking patch releases, as well as ensuring patches are tested, deployed, and verified in a timely manner. The team will maintain an inventory of all systems and software requiring patches and updates.
- **System Owners**:  
    System owners are responsible for ensuring that systems under their care are patched according to the defined timelines and that all systems are included in the patch management process. They should assist with testing and deployment for specific systems.
- **Vendors/Third-Party Providers**:  
    Third-party vendors or service providers should ensure that any systems, applications, or software they supply or manage are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches. The organization will evaluate third-party patch management practices during vendor assessments.

**3.4 Patch Management Tools**

- **Automated Patch Management Systems**:  
    The organization should use an automated patch management solution to deploy, track, and verify patches across the environment. This solution will help ensure compliance with patch management timelines and reduce human error.
- **Monitoring Tools**:  
    Patch compliance and the status of patches should be continuously monitored using appropriate systems. Alerts should be configured to notify administrators when patches are overdue or not successfully applied.

**3.5 Exceptions and Risk Management**

- **Patch Exceptions**:  
    If a patch cannot be applied due to compatibility issues or other reasons, a formal exception process must be followed. A risk assessment will be conducted to determine the level of risk associated with not applying the patch, and mitigation measures (e.g., additional monitoring or controls) will be implemented.
- **Documentation of Exceptions**:  
    Any exception to patching must be documented, including the reasons for the exception, the identified risk, and the mitigation actions taken. The exception will be reviewed periodically to determine if the patch can be applied later.

**3.6 Patch Management Auditing and Reporting**

- **Auditing**:  
    Regular audits of the patch management process will be conducted to ensure that patches are being applied in accordance with the policy. This includes verifying that patches are being deployed on time and systems are kept up-to-date.
- **Compliance Reporting**:  
    Regular patch compliance reports will be generated and reviewed by the security team and senior management. The reports will detail the status of patch deployment, any delays, and any critical vulnerabilities that have been addressed.

**3.7 Patch Management on Endpoints and Mobile Devices**

- **Endpoint Management**:  
    All endpoint devices (laptops, desktops, mobile devices) must be managed using endpoint management software to ensure timely patching. Devices that are not connected to the corporate network should be configured to automatically download and install patches whenever they are online.
- **Mobile Device Management (MDM)**:  
    Mobile devices should be enrolled in the organization’s Mobile Device Management (MDM) system to enforce patch management policies. The MDM system should ensure that mobile operating systems and applications are up-to-date with the latest patches.

**4\. Roles and Responsibilities**

- **IT/Security Team**:  
    Responsible for patch identification, deployment, testing, and monitoring. Ensure compliance with patch management timelines.
- **System Owners**:  
    Ensure that all systems under their ownership are patched and that they report on patch status.
- **Vendors/Service Providers**:  
    Responsible for providing timely patches and security updates for third-party applications and services.

**5\. Enforcement**  
Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, including termination of employment, and could be subject to legal action, depending on the severity of the non-compliance and its impact on the organization's security posture.

**6\. Documentation and Recordkeeping**  
All patch management activities, including patch identification, testing, deployment, exceptions, and audits, must be documented and retained in accordance with the organization's record retention policies.

**7\. Review and Revision**  
This policy will be reviewed annually, or more frequently if necessary, to account for changes in technology, regulatory requirements, or organizational needs.
