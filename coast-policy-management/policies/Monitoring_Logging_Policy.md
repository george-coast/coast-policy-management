**Monitoring and Logging Policy**

**1\. Purpose**  
The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for the monitoring of organizational systems and logging of critical events to ensure security, maintain operational integrity, and comply with regulatory requirements such as NIST 800-53.

**2\. Scope**  
This policy applies to all organizational systems, including servers, workstations, networks, applications, and cloud services, as well as to all employees, contractors, and third parties with access to these resources.

**3\. Policy Statement**

**3.1 System Monitoring**

- **Continuous Monitoring**: All critical systems and networks must be continuously monitored for security and operational events.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Approved monitoring tools and solutions (e.g., SIEM systems, intrusion detection systems) must be used to collect and analyze events in real time.
- **Coverage**: Monitoring must cover:
  - Unauthorized access attempts.
  - Configuration changes.
  - Malware detections.
  - Network traffic anomalies.

**3.2 Logging Requirements**

- **Log Sources**: Systems must generate logs for:
  - Authentication and access control events.
  - System changes and administrative actions.
  - Security alerts and incidents.
  - Application activity for critical services.
- **Log Content**: Logs must capture:
  - Timestamp (using a synchronized time source).
  - Event source (e.g., system name, IP address).
  - User information (e.g., username, user ID).
  - Event details (e.g., action taken, success/failure).

**3.3 Log Collection and Centralization**

- All logs must be transmitted securely to a centralized logging solution for aggregation, analysis, and storage.
- Logs must be protected during transmission using encryption protocols like TLS.

**3.4 Log Retention**

- Logs must be retained for a minimum of 12 months or longer based on legal, regulatory, or operational needs.
- Logs required for investigations must be preserved beyond the retention period until the case is resolved.

**3.5 Alerting and Notifications**

- Monitoring systems must be configured to generate alerts for suspicious activities, policy violations, or critical system events.
- Alerts must be sent to designated personnel for timely investigation and response.

**3.6 Access Control**

- Access to logs and monitoring systems must be restricted to authorized personnel only.
- Privileged access to logs must require multi-factor authentication (MFA).

**3.7 Log Review and Analysis**

- Logs must be reviewed periodically to identify anomalies, patterns of misuse, or security incidents.
- Automated tools must be employed to enhance the efficiency of log analysis.

**3.8 Incident Response**

- Monitoring and log data must be used to support incident detection, analysis, and response.
- Logs must be available for forensic investigations following a security breach.

**3.9 Time Synchronization**

- All systems must synchronize their clocks using a trusted time source (e.g., NTP server) to ensure consistent and accurate log timestamps.

**4\. Roles and Responsibilities**

**4.1 IT and Security Teams**

- Configure and manage monitoring and logging systems.
- Analyze and respond to alerts and log data.
- Ensure compliance with this policy and address any gaps.

**4.2 System Administrators**

- Ensure proper configuration of logging on all managed systems.
- Report log-related issues to the security team promptly.

**4.3 Compliance and Audit Teams**

- Conduct regular audits of log management practices to ensure policy adherence.
- Validate the effectiveness of monitoring systems.

**4.4 All Users**

- Report suspicious activities or potential security issues to the appropriate teams.

**5\. Enforcement**  
Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, loss of access privileges, and/or legal consequences.

**6\. Review and Revision**  
This policy will be reviewed annually or after significant changes to the IT environment, regulatory requirements, or monitoring technologies.
