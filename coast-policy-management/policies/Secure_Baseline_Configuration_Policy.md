**Secure Baseline Configuration Policy**

**1\. Purpose**  
The purpose of this policy is to establish and enforce secure baseline configurations for organizational systems, applications, and devices to reduce vulnerabilities, ensure compliance, and maintain system integrity.

**2\. Scope**  
This policy applies to all organizational systems, networks, applications, and devices, including on-premises, cloud-based, and third-party-managed environments.

**3\. Policy Statement**

**3.1 Establishing Secure Baselines**

- Each system, application, and device must have a documented secure baseline configuration.
- Baselines must be aligned with industry best practices, regulatory requirements, and organizational security policies.
- Secure baseline configurations must include:
  - Approved operating system versions.
  - Installed software and patches.
  - Standard network configurations (e.g., IPs, ports, firewalls).
  - Security controls such as encryption, logging, and access permissions.

**3.2 Maintaining Secure Baselines**

- Secure baselines must be reviewed and updated:
  - Annually.
  - When new vulnerabilities or threats are identified.
  - During significant system changes or upgrades.

**3.3 Deployment and Monitoring**

- All new systems and applications must be configured to meet the approved secure baseline before deployment.
- Automated tools must be used to continuously monitor systems for deviations from the baseline.
- Deviations must be documented, justified, and remediated promptly.

**3.4 Unauthorized Changes**

- Any changes to a system's configuration outside the approved baseline must be:
  - Documented and approved by the Change Control Board (CCB).
  - Rolled back if deemed unauthorized or insecure.

**3.5 Exceptions**

- Exceptions to baseline configurations must be documented, including the business justification and associated risks.
- Exceptions must be reviewed and approved by the IT security team.

**4\. Roles and Responsibilities**

**4.1 IT and Security Teams**

- Develop and maintain secure baseline configurations for all systems.
- Monitor systems for compliance with baselines and remediate deviations.
- Provide training on secure baseline configuration requirements.

**4.2 System Owners**

- Ensure systems are deployed and maintained according to secure baseline standards.
- Collaborate with IT teams to remediate deviations or request exceptions.

**4.3 Change Control Board (CCB)**

- Review and approve changes to secure baselines or deviations from approved configurations.

**5\. Enforcement**  
Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action or system disconnection. Unauthorized changes to system configurations will be reverted or addressed as security incidents.

**6\. Review and Revision**  
This policy will be reviewed annually or when significant changes to systems, technology, or threat landscapes occur.
